## ABOUT
This is a Teaching assistant program aimed at testing astronauts in training, based on a LLM model, by presenting them with scenerios based on real world emergency scenerios that can happen during space exploration, in order to test their decision-making skills, critical thinking, 
and reaction time in mock life or death situations.
