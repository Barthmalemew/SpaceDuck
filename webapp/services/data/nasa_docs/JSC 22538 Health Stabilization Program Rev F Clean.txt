 PURPOSE

This document establishes requirements for the United States (U.S.) Human Space Flight Program relating to the Flight Crew Health Stabilization Program (HSP) for launches from the
U.S. The HSP constitutes the U.S. implementation of internationally approved health stabilization guidelines for the prevention of infectious disease specified in SSP 50480-ANX1.

SCOPE
This document delineates the medical operations requirements for the NASA HSP. The HSP goals are accomplished through an awareness campaign and procedures such as limiting access to crewmembers, medical screening, vaccinations, and restriction of crewmember activities.
The medical operations requirements baselined in this document are applicable to crewed space flight vehicles launched from the U.S. for NASA missions, or that involve NASA assets such as NASA astronauts, the International Space Station (ISS), or other orbital resources such as the Orion Vehicle, and Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Programs' vehicles, including but not limited to, Gateway and Human Landing System (HLS) vehicles.

HSP IMPLEMENTATION FOR U.S LAUNCHES
NASA's Human Space Flight Program uses strategic risk mitigation to achieve mission success while protecting crew health and safety. Infectious diseases can compromise crew health and mission success, especially in the immediate preflight period. The primary purpose of the HSP is to mitigate the risk of occurrence of infectious disease among astronaut crews during the mission. Infectious diseases are spread through person-to-person contact, via vectors, and through contact with infectious material in the environment. The HSP establishes several controls to minimize crew exposure to infectious agents and to maintain immune status.


As applicable, biomedical data on crewmembers and HSP participants becomes a protected part of their individual medical record. Provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regarding control of records, information exchange, and release of health information to the public are strictly followed.

PERSONNEL GROUPS
Individuals who must have close contact (within 6 feet / 2 meters for any duration) with the crew or will enter quarantine facilities during the quarantine period are identified as HSP participants. HSP participants may also be referred to as Primary Contacts (PCs). Astronaut crewmembers are HSP participants. The Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) authorizes HSP participant status based on the job duties during the pre-launch quarantine period.
Alternatively, for Private Astronaut Missions (PAM) without NASA crew, the PAM provider may authorize HSP participant status. Individuals without HSP participant status are not permitted close contact with crew or access into quarantine facilities during the quarantine period unless authorized by the HSP Lead Surgeon. The type and duration of interaction dictates the specific requirements for HSP participants.

These requirements apply to the HSP participant groups described in sections 7.2-7.4 (Groups A-C). Additional group-specific details are identified in the subsequent sections.


A. Education - All HSP participants shall complete annual HSP training. Training may be delivered by means of computer-based training, written document, or presentation. This educational training shall include discussion, and where applicable, demonstration of specific preventive techniques. The NASA HSP team will provide training materials for all NASA personnel. Other organizations such as Commercial Providers or International Partners may provide their own educational briefings to satisfy this requirement. NASA shall assess whether the education materials provided satisfy the education requirement.
B. Medical Screening - Shall be performed per the group-specific requirements in the subsequent sections. Initial and periodic screening may be required. If temperature is measured, fever is defined as 100.4º F or greater.
C. Immunization - Appropriate immunization provides a high degree of protection against specific pathogens. Immunizations shall be verified per the group-specific requirements in the subsequent sections.
D. Quarantine Period - The quarantine period begins at close of business fourteen days prior to launch (L-14 days). The quarantine period ends after launch (once the spacecraft departs the launchpad with astronauts onboard). However, if vehicle, weather, or other factors cause a significant delay, HSP Lead Surgeon will determine whether to extend the quarantine period or terminate until a new launch date is established.
E. Quarantine Measures
1. Social Distancing - Limit close contact (definition in section 7.0) with others to the greatest extent possible.
2. Respiratory Hygiene - Use respiratory Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Cough or sneeze into a sleeve or tissue. Follow with immediate hand hygiene.
3. Hand Hygiene - Frequently clean hands using alcohol-based sanitizer (minimum alcohol content = 60%) or soap & water. Clean hands after touching surfaces or other people.
4. Limitation of Exposure - Minimize exposure to infectious disease threats (avoid crowds, sick contacts, etc.). Symptomatic or sick personnel shall not participate in quarantine until determined to be no longer infectious by HSP Lead Surgeon.
5. Self-Monitoring - Monitor for signs or symptoms of infectious disease. Report concerns to supervisor and HSP team. Do not report to work if potentially unwell.
F. PPE - When required, PPE nominally consists of a surgical mask or better. Gloves may be utilized, but thorough hand hygiene is considered to be a higher priority. In circumstances requiring the use of a mask to protect others, or an N95 respirator to protect the wearer, cloth face coverings shall not be used as a substitute. Masks or respirators with valves shall not be used.
G. Identification - Within the quarantine period, HSP participants shall be visually identifiable, either by badging or similar means such as badge placards or stickers.
H. Duration of Contact - Shall minimize duration of interpersonal contact with HSP


participants and non-HSP personnel. For non-quarantine facility residents, shall minimize time in quarantine facilities.
I. Responsibility - Shall carry personal responsibility for infectious disease prevention and undertake every available measure to protect their health.
J. Emerging Threats or Other Concerns - HSP Lead Surgeon may implement measures or modifications to mitigate risk posed by emerging pathogens/threats, geographically- prevalent infectious disease, or other concerns. Measures may include (but are not limited to) targeted training, additional screening or testing, new immunizations, stricter quarantine measures, or vector control (eradication of pathogen-carrying organisms such as mosquitos).
7.2 GROUP A
BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Close contact without PPE.
DEFINITION: Personnel who will live in quarantine facilities with the astronaut crewmembers, or who will have frequent close contact with the crew, their families, or others living in quarantine facilities. This group encompasses personnel who are included in the Operational Group (OG) in SSP 50480-ANX1.
EXAMPLES: Crew, crew families, quarantine facility residents (e.g. CB chief, crew surgeons, FOD director, Vehicle Integration & Test Office [VITO] chief), immediate family escorts, and family services coordinators.
REQUIREMENTS:
A. Education - Shall complete the standard briefing.
B. Medical Screening - Shall undergo pre-quarantine medical screening that may take place in person or electronically (per examining physician's discretion). Shall undergo periodic medical screening on a daily basis while residing in a quarantine facility. Periodic medical screening may also be required by HSP Lead Surgeon while residing outside of a quarantine facility.
C. Immunization - Shall have up-to-date immunizations per 7.6. Exceptions are unlikely but shall be considered by the HSP Lead Surgeon on a case-by-case basis.
D. Limitation of Exposure - Shall minimize infectious disease threats during the quarantine period by adhering to quarantine measures.
1. Shall not visit stores or restaurants. Shall utilize delivery or contactless pick-up services instead.
2. May perform in-person job duties that are related to the launch. For example, may meet with HSP participants for mission-related briefings, but shall not participate in unrelated in-person activities such as Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) training or a Public Affairs Office (PAO) event.
3. Commercial air travel is considered a break in quarantine. If traveling via private aircraft with non-HSP personnel, shall make every effort to separate HSP and non-HSP personnel on the ground and in-flight.


E. Housing - Shall be billeted in sequestered accommodation such as the quarantine facilities described in 9.1. Home quarantine is permissible if the HSP requirements and these additional requirements can be met:
1. Cohabitants shall not perform in-person work, school, or other activities.
F. PPE - Shall utilize PPE while in close contact with personnel outside of this group.
G. Late Entry - Permissible via pathway described in 7.9.2.
7.3 GROUP B
BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Close contact with PPE.
DEFINITION: Personnel who may have close contact with the crew or Group A personnel, but who will not live in the quarantine facilities. Like Group A, this group encompasses personnel who are included in the OG in SSP 50480-ANX1.
EXAMPLES: Commercial provider medical personnel, commercial provider suit technicians, food service workers, HSP team, suit room personnel, medical and nursing personnel working in Astronaut Crew Quarters (ACQ)/Crew Exam Facility (CEF), medical personnel supporting crew immediate families.
REQUIREMENTS:
A. Education - Shall complete the standard briefing.
B. Medical Screening - Shall undergo pre-quarantine medical screening that may take place in person or electronically (per examining physician's discretion). Periodic medical screening may be required by HSP Lead Surgeon.
C. Immunization - Shall have up-to-date immunizations per 7.6. Exceptions shall be considered by the HSP Lead Surgeon on a case-by-case basis.
D. Limitation of Exposure - Shall minimize infectious disease threats during the quarantine period by adhering to quarantine measures.
1. Shall not nominally visit stores or restaurants. Shall utilize delivery or contactless pick-up services instead when feasible. Shall limit store or restaurant visits to those required for HSP support when delivery is not feasible.
2. May perform in-person job duties that are related to the launch. For example, may meet HSP participants for mission-related briefings, but shall not participate in unrelated in-person activities such as NBL training or a PAO event.
3. Commercial air travel is considered a break in quarantine. If traveling via private aircraft with non-HSP personnel, shall make every effort to separate HSP and non-HSP personnel on the ground and in-flight.
E. Housing - Home quarantine is permissible and expected if the HSP requirements can be met.
F. PPE - Shall utilize PPE while in quarantine facilities or in close contact with HSP participants.
G. Late Entry - Permissible via pathway described in 7.9.2. HSP Lead Surgeon may authorize late entry for members of this group without an observation period on a case-


by-case basis.
7.4 GROUP C
BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Social distance and PPE.
DEFINITION: Personnel who may access quarantine facilities but will not have close contact with the crew or Group A/B personnel.
EXAMPLES: Quarantine facility administrative assistants, quarantine facility housekeeping, pad workers, Protective Services personnel who provide access control but do not come into close contact with the crew or Group A/B personnel.
REQUIREMENTS:
A. Education - Shall complete the standard briefing.
B. Medical Screening - Shall undergo pre-quarantine medical screening that may take place in person or electronically (per examining physician's discretion). Periodic medical screening may be required by HSP Lead Surgeon.
C. Immunization - Shall have up-to-date immunizations per 7.6. Exceptions shall be considered by the HSP Lead Surgeon on a case-by-case basis. Other vaccines not required for this group per 7.6 are strongly recommended.
D. Limitation of Exposure - Shall minimize infectious disease threats during the quarantine period by adhering to quarantine measures.
E. Housing - Home quarantine is permissible and expected, but these requirements shall be met:
1. Shall not nominally visit stores or restaurants unless absolutely necessary. Strongly encourage delivery or contactless pick-up services instead.
F. PPE - Shall utilize PPE while in quarantine facilities or when in close contact with HSP participants.
G. Late Entry - Permissible without special restrictions.
7.5 GROUP D
BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Behind-the-glass (visit performed across a glass partition), or social distance and PPE.
DEFINITION: Personnel do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the HSP, but in whom the HSP has an interest due to infrequent access to quarantine facilities, or behind-the-glass or socially distanced encounters with the crew. These personnel are not considered to be HSP participants and are not nominally subject to the requirements described in 7.1, but must meet the criteria described below before encounters.
EXAMPLES: Aircrew and ramp workers involved in transportation of HSP participants, non-HSP crew family members, special guests, or Very Important Persons (VIPs) who meet with the crew


via behind-the-glass or socially-distanced encounters, maintenance workers who must enter a quarantine facility to fix an issue.
REQUIREMENTS:
A. Education - N/A.
B. Medical Screening - Shall undergo symptom and temperature screening prior to encounters (as applicable).
C. Immunization - N/A.
D. Limitation of Exposure - N/A.
E. Housing - N/A.

Submission of a preliminary list at this date provides adequate time for the HSP, VITO, and clinic teams to authorize HSP participation, enroll the participants in training, verify immunization status, and perform any necessary remediation steps while maintaining other ongoing non-HSP functions (e.g. fitness-for-duty exams in the clinics).
7.9 QUARANTINE ENTRY OPTIONS FOR GROUPS A & B
7.9.1 OPTION 1 - ENTRY AT L-14 DAYS
A. Asymptomatic participants age 12 and older may enter quarantine via the nominal process.
B. Children under the age of 12 are considered on a case-by-case basis upon request of the crewmember and in coordination with the sponsoring Agency. Assessment of infectious disease risk shall include evaluation for ability to adhere to control measures. An accompanying behavioral control person (e.g. family member in quarantine besides the crewmember, crew surgeons, or manager) shall be available. For ISS missions, additional criteria described in SSP 50480-ANX1 shall be met.
7.9.2 OPTION 2 - ENTRY AFTER L-14 DAYS
A. Asymptomatic participants age 12 and older entering quarantine after L-14 days shall complete a 7-day observation period before direct interactions with crewmembers or HSP participants. At a minimum, participants in an observation period shall receive a medical assessment at the start and end of the period, continuously self-monitor for


symptoms of an infectious condition, and follow all quarantine measures. During the observation period, direct contact with crewmembers or HSP participants is restricted, but interactions across a glass partition and/or with social distancing are permitted.
Following the observation period, and once approved by the HSP Lead Surgeon, participants may join the appropriate HSP participant group.
B. Children under the age of 12 shall not enter quarantine after L-14 days, in accordance with SSP 50480-ANX1 (as applicable).
C. Crew contact with additional measures such as PPE and/or social distancing may be allowed by HSP Lead Surgeon for critical encounters.

 FACILITIES
9.1 QUARANTINE FACILITIES
Dedicated quarantine facilities are the crewmembers' primary residence during the quarantine period. These facilities, which include their personal home, Astronaut Quarantine Facility (AQF) at JSC, ACQ at KSC, or other HSP-approved similar facilities, provide a quiet, clean, comfortable living environment where the crewmembers can prepare for the upcoming mission in a sequestered setting. Access to these facilities is limited to authorized personnel.
Regardless of planned occupancy, quarantine facilities shall be available at the start of the quarantine period. If illness develop among family members that necessitates placing crewmembers in quarantine prematurely, or if home quarantine conditions are broken, crewmembers may need to relocate to these dedicated quarantine facilities prior to L-14 days.
Simultaneous use of quarantine facilities for separate operations (e.g. overlapping launch and landing) is discouraged. However, should this become necessary, the separate groups shall maintain best-effort social distancing at all times (e.g. reside in different wings, dine at separate times). Furthermore, in this situation, all quarantine residents shall observe the requirements in section 7.0.
Quarantine facilities shall be cleaned prior to the commencement of each quarantine period. Facility Managers shall inspect the quarantine facilities to ensure they are sufficiently clean per HSP Cleaning Instructions. Additionally, facility inspections shall include water pathogen testing (as appropriate), and air handling unit testing for pathogens (as appropriate) within the past year. Quarantine facilities shall have ample locations for hand hygiene and PPE.
The interior of the spacecraft is also considered to be a quarantine facility, and personnel entering it during the quarantine period shall participate in the HSP.
9.2 RESTRICTED ACCESS FACILITIES
Quarantined crewmembers require access to a number of mission-related facilities whose access is limited to authorized personnel only during the quarantine period. Crewmember use of restricted access facilities does not violate HSP policy provided that facility staff follow HSP requirements. These facilities include:
A. Johnson Space Center
1. Columbia Center (Building 26)
2. Neutral Buoyancy Lab
3. Baseline Data Collection (BDC) Facilities
4. Onsite Training Facilities
5. Offsite Training Facilities (e.g. commercial provider)
B. Kennedy Space Center
1. Beach House
2. Launch Pad(s)


C. Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Launch Pad(s)
D. Other similar facilities as defined by HSP Lead Surgeon
9.3 GENERAL ACCESS FACILITIES
Crewmembers may transit through general access facilities during the quarantine period, where contact with the general population can occur. Such facilities include guard stations, airfield operations facilities and flight lines. There are no quarantine-specific facility requirements in these areas.
Protective Services is responsible for sequestering non-quarantined individuals out of close contact with HSP participants during visits to general access facilities.
DEVIATIONS, OCCURRENCES, AND VARIANCES
Deviations from the requirements established in this document, process escapes, and/or symptoms of infectious disease that occur amongst HSP participants during the quarantine period shall be promptly reported to the HSP Lead Surgeon for assessment of risk to the crew and mission.
10.1 PRE-FLIGHT: WAIVER PROCESS
Upon identification of any deviation or escape from health stabilization requirements and/or symptoms of infectious disease among the HSP participants during the quarantine period, the HSP Lead Surgeon shall assess the risk to the crew and mission.
HSP Lead Surgeon is the decision authority for waivers and shall make determinations in consultation with the crew surgeons, IDCT, and VITO Chief. As appropriate, HH&P management and other entities (e.g. Flight Directors, FOD management, NASA Mission Management Team, NASA ISS Mission Management Team, NASA leadership, IP representatives) may be briefed to ensure that the correct mission objectives are accounted for.
HSP Lead Surgeon may impose stricter mitigation measures that may include (but are not limited to) additional screening or testing, immunizations, stricter quarantine measures, or vector control (eradication of pathogen-carrying organisms such as mosquitos).
10.2 POST-FLIGHT: DEVIATIONS, OCCURRENCES, AND VARIANCES REPORTING
HSP Lead Surgeon shall work with the appropriate programs and organizations to ensure that all deviations, occurrences, and variances are reported for record and included in mission- specific lessons learned.
HH&P and FOD shall include appropriate information in post-flight lessons learned reports to the affected program(s) per their established processes.
If infectious transmission to crewmembers occurs, the HSP Lead Surgeon shall generate a report summarizing the results of any investigative efforts to identify the factors that led to the


infection. This report shall be shared with HH&P management, and the appropriate programs, organizations, and parties.
DORMANCY AND REACTIVATION
The HSP is nominally in continuous effect while U.S. launches are occurring on a regular basis. The HSP may enter dormancy after a launch if no U.S. launches are planned within 12 months. The HSP shall be reactivated from dormancy no later than 6 months prior to the first scheduled launch.
