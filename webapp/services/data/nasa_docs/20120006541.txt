Definition of Astronaut


• The term "astronaut" derives from the Greek words meaning "space sailor," and refers to all who have been launched as crew members aboard NASA spacecraft bound for orbit and beyond.

• Since the inception of NASA's human space flight program, we have also maintained the term "astronaut" as the title for those selected to join the NASA corps of astronauts who make "space sailing" their career profession.

• The term "cosmonaut" refers to those space sailors who are members of the Russian space program.






Definition of Astronaut
(continued)
• The crew of each launched spacecraft is made up of astronauts and/or cosmonauts.

• The crew assignments and duties of commander, pilot, Space Shuttle mission specialist, or International Space Station flight engineer are drawn from the NASA professional career astronauts.

• A special category of astronauts typically titled "payload specialist" refers to individuals selected and trained by commercial or research organizations for flights of a specific payload on a space flight mission.
At the present time, these payload specialists may be cosmonauts or astronauts designated by the international partners, individuals selected by the research community, or a company or consortia flying a commercial payload aboard the spacecraft.





Space Flyers Categories



• Active astronauts are U.S. astronauts who are currently eligible for flight assignment, including those who are assigned to crews.

• Management astronauts are experienced astronauts who have been promoted to other positions within NASA, or astronauts on special duty assignments or sabbaticals that make them unavailable for direct support to the Astronaut Office.

• Former astronauts are those who have left NASA after a career in the Astronaut Corps, including those who are deceased.

• International astronauts are those individuals from international space agencies who have trained at Johnson Space Center and serve as mission specialists with NASA.

• Japanese
• Europeans

- Cosmonauts:
• Russians

Astronaut Selection Facts




• The first U.S. astronauts were selected in 1959, before human spaceflight operations
began. NASA asked the military services to provide a list of personnel who met specific qualifications.
Scott Carpenter,
After stringent screening, NASA announced	Gordon cooper,

its selection of seven men, all pilots, as the	11-e..:.

;i..	• 1.	John Glenn,

first American astronauts.	Gus Grissom,
Walter Schirra,
NASA has selected 18 more groups of	Alan Shepard, and

astronauts since the "Original Seven."

Deke Slayton.


The backgrounds of NASA's latest group of Astronaut Candidates include school teachers, doctors, scientist, and engineers.

• NASA selects astronauts from a diverse pool of applicants with a wide variety of backgrounds.
From the thousands of applications received, only a few are chosen for the intensive Astronaut Candidate training program.
Including the "Original Seven", only 330 astronauts have been selected to date.

• The astronauts of the 21st century will help lead NASA through the next steps of its Vision for Space Exploration as we explore the Moon, Mars, and beyond.






General Program Requirements
1) Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.

2) The astronaut candidates will undergo a training and evaluation period lasting Approximately 2 years, during which time they will participate in the basic Astronaut Candidate training program, which is designated to develop the knowledge and skills required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight.
Astronaut Candidates (Piloting background) will maintain	/	--c
proficiency in NASA aircraft during their candidate period.	/
(Applicant -	Candidate -	Astronaut "penguin" -	Flown Astronaut)
3) As part of the Astronaut Candidate training program, Astronaut Candidates are required to complete military water survival before beginning their flying syllabus, and become SCUBA qualified to prepare them for the EVA training.. Consequently, all Astronaut Candidates will be required to pass a swimming test during their first month of training. They must swim
3 lengths of a 25-M pool without stopping, and then swim
3 lengths of the pool in a flight suit and tennis shoes. There
is no time limit.  They must also tread water continuously for 10 minutes.





General Program Requirements
(continued)



4) Applicants should be aware that selection as an Astronaut Candidate does NOT
ensure selection as an astronaut.
Final selection as an astronaut will depend upon satisfactory completion of the training and evaluation period.
Civilian candidates who successfully complete the training and evaluation and
are selected as astronauts will become permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for a period of at least 5 years.

5) Civilian candidates who are NOT selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA, depending upon Agency requirements and labor constraints at that time.
Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a specified tour of duty.

6) NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified minorities and women among those selected as Astronaut Candidates.
Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.

Astronaut Candidate (Non-Piloting background)
Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science, or mathematics. Quality of academic preparation is important.
Degree must be followed by at least 3 years of related, progressively responsible, professional experience.
An advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for experience as follows: master's degree = 1 year of experience, doctoral degree = 3 years of experience.
Teaching experience, including experience at the K - 12 levels, is considered to be qualifying experience for the Astronaut Candidate position; therefore, educators are encouraged to apply.
Ability to pass the NASA long-duration space flight physical, which includes the following specific requirements:	·

Distant visual acuity: Must be correctable to 20/20, each eye

(NOTE: For those applicants under final consideration, additional visual screening will be performed to include the following standards: refractive error (distant vision)-cycloplegic refractive error must be between +5.50 and -5.50 diopters in any meridian. Astigmatism may require up to 3.00 diopters of cylinder correction. Anisometropia of up to 3.50 diopters. You are not required to provide this information with your initial application. We will request it later if needed:)

Near visual acuity: Must be correctable to 20/20, each eye

The refractive surgical procedures of the eye, PRK and LASIK, are now allowed, providing at least 1 year has passed since the date of the procedure with no permanent adverse after effects. For those applicants under final consideration, an operative report on the surgical procedure will be requested.

Astronaut Training Process



The water within the NBL is recycled every 19.6 hours. It is automatically monitored and controlled to a temperature of 82-88 degrees Fahrenheit to minimize the potential effects of hypothermia on support divers. It is also chemically treated to control contaminant growth while minimizing long-term corrosion effects on training mockups and equipment.

Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL). The NBL was sized to perform two activities simultaneously; each uses mockups sufficiently large to produce meaningful training content and duration. It is 202 ft in length, 102 ft in width, and 40 ft in depth (20 ft above ground level and 20 ft below) and holds 6.2 million gallons of water. Even at this size, the International Space Station, at 350 ft x 240 ft when complete, will not fit inside the NBL.
