Best Practices Handbook

Preface
Since Explorer 1 was launched on January 31, 1958, the United States (U.S.) has reaped the
benefits of space exploration. New markets and new technologies have spurred the economy and
changed lives in many ways across the national security, civil, and commercial sectors. Space
technologies and space-based capabilities now provide global communications, navigation and
timing, weather forecasting, and more.
Space exploration also presents challenges that impact not only the U.S. but also its allies and
other partners. A significant increase in the volume and diversity of activity in space means that
it is becoming increasingly congested. Emerging commercial ventures such as satellite servicing,
in-space manufacturing, and tourism as well as new technologies enabling small satellites and
large constellations of satellites present serious challenges for safely and responsibly using space
in a stable, sustainable manner.
To meet these challenges, the U.S. seeks to improve global awareness of activity in space by
publicly sharing flight safety-related information and by coordinating its own on-orbit activity in
a safer, more responsible manner. It seeks to bolster stability and reduce current and future
operational on-orbit risks so that space is sustained for future generations. To this end, new and
better Space Situational Awareness (SSA) capabilities are needed to keep pace with the
increased congestion, and the U.S. seeks to create a dynamic environment that encourages and
rewards commercial providers who improve these capabilities.
The overall purpose of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Spacecraft
Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance Best Practices Handbook is to equip
owners/operators (O/Os) with the best practices they need to conduct their operations safely. The
Handbook
‚Ä¢

Reflects the goal of Space Policy Directive-3, the National Space Traffic Management
Policy (SPD-3), to develop safety standards and best practices that consider
‚Äúmaneuverability, tracking, reliability, and disposal.‚Äù

‚Ä¢

Reflects how NASA currently operates in space, which evolves over time.

‚Ä¢

Is organized around a spacecraft‚Äôs life cycle. Consideration is given to important topics
such as spacecraft and constellation design; spacecraft ‚Äútrackability;‚Äù pre-launch
preparation and early launch activities; on-orbit collision avoidance; and automated
trajectory guidance and maneuvering.

‚Ä¢

Encourages the use of commercially available SSA data and information, and for large
constellations, it encourages mitigating light pollution to ground-based astronomy.

‚Ä¢

Focuses on current NASA best practices. It will be updated as new approaches for
conjunction assessment and on-orbit operations are developed.

‚Ä¢

Provides guidance for the requirements in NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR)
8079.1, NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Analysis and Collision Avoidance for Space
Environment Protection.

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
A parallel document may be developed to highlight additional practices as the U.S. Department
of Commerce develops the Open Architecture Data Repository (OADR) mandated by
SPD-3. Other commercial services may be offered to supplement or replace the government
services currently offered.
The approaches outlined in this document are offered to spacecraft Owners/Operators (O/Os) as
an example of responsible practices to consider for lowering collision risks and operating safely
in space in a stable and sustainable manner. Entities offering, or intending to offer, SSA or
conjunction assessment services should consider the information in this handbook from the
perspective of augmenting or improving upon existing capabilities as the entire space industry
benefits from advancing these capabilities. In the near term, raw observation data can be used to
improve close approach predictions. Longer-term improvements might be found in enhancing
notifications and data sharing, developing new models, and enabling increased automation.
NASA continuously examines and actively updates its best practices for conjunction assessment
as the industry undergoes rapid evolution. Large constellations of satellites, for example,
comprise a new and evolving paradigm for which NASA is developing in-house expertise.
NASA seeks input from the community to improve the content presented in this document.
Comments or suggestions may be submitted to ca-handbook-feedback@nasa.onmicrosoft.com.
For space operations regulated by other U.S. agencies such as the Department of Commerce, the
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), NASA defers to those agencies. As part of interagency consultations and to
contribute to safe and sustainable space operations, NASA partners such as the FAA and FCC
request NASA review of license, payload, and/or policy applications made by commercial space
operators to U.S. Government regulatory agencies. In addition to the information required by
those regulatory agencies, NASA has prepared examples of information for various types of
missions that is valuable in expediting NASA‚Äôs review. Current examples can be found at
https://www.nasa.gov/recommendations-commercial-space-operators. Commercial space
operators are welcome to contact NASA with questions about these examples.
This document was developed in close collaboration with the U.S. Space Command
(USSPACECOM), one of NASA‚Äôs closest interagency partners in ensuring safe operations in
space, as part of the NASA/U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Interagency Working Group for
Large Constellation Conjunction Assessment Best Practices. Special thanks are due to working
group members Mr. Jeff Braxton of USSPACECOM‚Äôs Strategy, Plans, and Policy Directorate,
and Ms. Diana McKissock and Ms. Cynthia Wilson of the U.S. Space Force‚Äôs 18th Space
Defense Squadron (18 SDS).

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook

1.0 Introduction
This document is intended to provide NASA spacecraft program and project managers,
generically referred to in this handbook as O/Os, with more details on implementing
requirements in NPR 8079.1 and to provide non-NASA O/Os with a reference document
describing existing NASA conjunction assessment and collision avoidance practices.
Within NASA, space flight missions are typically implemented through a program/project office
structure. For example, a human exploration program might involve multiple missions (i.e.,
discrete launches) to a common goal. In this document, the term ‚Äúmission‚Äù means the end-to-end
activity that results in the creation, launch, operation, and eventual disposal of a spacecraft.
This document provides detailed information on spacecraft conjunction assessment and collision
avoidance topics. Best practices for each topic are described and justified throughout this
document by mission phase. A summary list of these best practices without the supporting
explanatory text is provided in appendices C and D. Appendix C is a complete listing of all the
best practices so that non-NASA mission managers can review them to determine which are
useful for their mission. The mission manager would then need to identify the person or group
responsible for performing the best practice and arrange for that effort. For NASA missions,
Appendix D lists the best practices and the party responsible for performing them.
Different organizations use the term ‚Äúconjunction assessment‚Äù in different ways, but NASA
defines a 3-step process:
1. Conjunction assessment (otherwise referred to as ‚Äúscreening‚Äù) ‚Äì The process of
comparing trajectory data from the ‚Äúprimary object‚Äù (the ‚Äúprotected asset‚Äù in NPR
8079.1) against the trajectories of the objects in the applicable database1 and predicts
when a close approach will occur within a chosen protective volume placed about the
asset.
2. Conjunction risk assessment ‚Äì The process of determining the likelihood of two space
objects colliding and the expected consequence if they collide in terms of lost spacecraft
and expected debris production.
3. Conjunction mitigation ‚Äì An action taken to remediate conjunction risk including a
propulsive maneuver, an attitude adjustment (e.g., for differential drag or to minimize
frontal area), or provision of ephemeris data to the secondary O/O to enable that
spacecraft to plan and execute an avoidance maneuver.

1

For Earth-orbiting objects, screening is performed against the space object catalog maintained by the United States
Space Command (USSPACECOM) to predict when a close approach will occur within a volume of space called a
‚Äúsafety volume‚Äù placed about the asset. This catalog includes information about international and commercial
operational spacecraft as well as all trackable debris. For non-Earth-orbiting objects, the ephemeris of the primary
(protected) asset is only screened against other provided ephemerides.

1.0 Introduction

3

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
This document compiles best practices based on the U.S. Government process that exists today
where conjunction assessment screening is performed by USSPACECOM/18 SDS and 19 SDS.
The risk assessment process is necessary because the orbit solutions of the catalog objects have
varying accuracies depending on factors described in this document. Currently, O/Os need to
perform this function for themselves (or hire a third party) because 18 SDS and 19 SDS are not
tasked to perform this necessary risk assessment function. In the future, the Department of
Commerce may offer risk assessment services as it takes on a space traffic management role, and
broader commercial services will be available.
Some entities use Two-Line Elements (TLEs) to perform conjunction assessment. This practice
is not recommended because the TLE accuracy is not sufficient to perform the necessary
conjunction assessment calculations. (See Appendix E for more information on TLEs.)
The terms ‚Äúsatellite‚Äù and ‚Äúspacecraft‚Äù are interchangeable in this document. The word ‚Äúobject‚Äù
means any discretely identifiable debris or other cataloged item in addition to satellites and
spacecraft.
The term ‚Äúlarge constellation‚Äù is defined loosely in this document. The U.S. Government Orbital
Debris Mitigation Standard Practices (ODMSP) defines ‚Äúlarge constellation‚Äù as containing 100
or more spacecraft. However, because constellations having as few as 10-20 spacecraft can
experience greater conjunction risk, the O/O of any constellation of spacecraft is asked to
consider the intent of the best practices in this document and implement all of them to the degree
possible.

Best Practices Handbook

2.0 Roles and Responsibilities
This section provides a brief introduction to the organizations referenced in this document.
The U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM), one of the combatant commands within DOD, is
responsible for U.S. military space operations. For the purposes of this document, it is the entity
responsible for establishing SSA sharing agreements with domestic and international entities,
both governmental and private. It establishes guidance and direction governing execution of the
congressionally mandated SSA sharing program on behalf of the U.S. Secretary of Defense. It
also oversees execution of the SSA sharing program as well as day-to-day operations of the
USSPACECOM SSA and space flight safety support.
The U.S. Space Force's 18th and 19th Space Defense Squadron (18 SDS and 19 SDS)
maintain the U.S. catalog of space objects and provide 24/7 space flight safety support on behalf
of USSPACECOM. 18 SDS conducts advanced analysis, sensor optimization, human space
flight support, reentry/break-up assessment, and launch analysis; 19 SDS conducts conjunction
assessment and launch conjunction assessment.
The NASA Human Space Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) of the Johnson Space Center
(JSC), through the console positions Trajectory Operations Officer (TOPO) and Flight Dynamics
Officer (FDO), provides conjunction risk analysis support to the space flight missions that fall
under NASA human space flight. The International Space Station (ISS) and vehicles visiting the
ISS receive conjunction risk assessment support from the TOPO,2 while Artemis space flight
missions receive conjunction risk assessment support from their assigned FDO. The TOPO
group is the sole liaison to USSPACECOM and the U.S. Space Force for matters related to
trajectory maintenance and the orbital safety of human space flight assets.
The NASA Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) Program located at the Goddard
Space Flight Center (GSFC) provides conjunction analysis and risk assessment services for all
NASA spacecraft not affiliated with human space flight. CARA is responsible for protecting the
orbital environment from collision between NASA non-human space flight missions and other
tracked and cataloged on-orbit objects. CARA is responsible for routinely collecting predicted
orbital information from NASA spacecraft operators, passing it to NASA Orbital Safety Analysts
(OSAs) for screening against the space object catalog, analyzing the screening results to
determine the risk posed by predicted close approaches, and working with NASA spacecraft
operators to determine an appropriate mitigation strategy for the risks posed by close approaches.
CARA is the sole entity with authority to submit Orbital Data Requests (ODRs) to DOD on
behalf of NASA non-human space flight entities in accordance with NPR( 8715.6, NASA
Procedural Requirements for Limiting Orbital Debris and Evaluating the Meteoroid and Orbital
Debris Environments. CARA is the designated point of contact between NASA and
USSPACECOM and the U.S. Space Force for matters related to trajectory maintenance and
orbital safety of non-human space flight assets.

However, for missions deployed from ISS or visiting vehicles, JSC FOD certifies that the mission has a
conjunction assessment process as outlined in jettison policies but does not provide direct conjunction risk
assessment support.

Best Practices Handbook

3.0 Conjunction Assessment: Past, Present, and Future
This section provides a brief history of the conjunction assessment function, including an
overview of who the actors are and why the activities are arranged as they are. It explains why
the conjunction assessment and related safety-of-flight services currently available exist in their
present forms and how they are evolving to accommodate new requirements.

Origins
The present conjunction assessment process, which predicts close approaches between space
objects, began in support of the NASA Space Shuttle Program return-to-flight effort after the
Challenger accident in 1986. Drawing on the DOD‚Äôs ability to track space objects for missile
defense and SSA, the two U.S. Government entities partnered to expand the capability to offer a
methodology that would protect humans in space.
What most people consider the ‚Äúspace catalog‚Äù is a database of TLE sets that permits a mediumfidelity propagation and orbit prediction of all tracked objects larger than approximately 10 cm in
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using Simplified General Perturbation Theory #4 (SGP4).3 The satellite
catalog was originally designed not for conjunction assessment but for generalized space safety,
predicting the location of objects with sufficient accuracy for sensors in the network to reacquire
those objects, thereby maintaining custody for purposes such as ensuring that intercontinental
ballistic missile threats could be differentiated from satellites in orbit. The catalog was then, and
is today, maintained using the radars, telescopes, and other sensors comprising the Space
Surveillance Network (SSN). In recent years, however, USSPACECOM has been working to
augment the existing network by incorporating observations from international and commercial
entities.
For ISS conjunction assessment to better protect humans in space, NASA collaborated with the
U.S. Air Force to develop an improvement to the TLE catalog that would be accurate enough to
compute a Probability of Collision (Pc) between two objects. To compute Pc, orbit determination
covariance data were needed. Since the general perturbations theory used to maintain the TLE
catalog (SGP4) did not produce a usable covariance, the current Special Perturbations (SP) Space
Object Catalog was developed. 18 SDS, the U.S. Space Force unit that currently maintains the
catalog at Vandenberg Space Force Base (VSFB) on behalf of USSPACECOM, 18 SDS at
VSFB, California and 19 SDS at Dahlgren Naval Base, Virginia have greatly expanded the
process of screening protected assets since that time (especially since the Iridium 33/COSMOS
2251 collision in 2009) to include all operational assets currently on orbit.
However, since the process was developed 50 years ago and was grown piecemeal to meet
existing needs, it contains certain oddities of evolution that may not be anticipated by O/Os who
are accustomed to using current technology and methods. Understanding how the 18 and 19 SDS
process works is key to using it properly to protect on-orbit assets and the space environment.

USSPACECOM Conjunction Assessment Process
The full conjunction assessment screening process used by USSPACECOM with all
accompanying details is documented in the Spaceflight Safety Handbook for Satellite Operators
(the Spaceflight Safety Handbook), which can be obtained along with other helpful information
from the USSPACECOM website space-track.org. This website is the principal way
USSPACECOM communicates and exchanges conjunction assessment-related information with
O/Os.
‚Ä¢

All non-NASA spacecraft O/Os should familiarize themselves with the Spaceflight
Safety Handbook as well as other website contents and offerings.

‚Ä¢

NASA spacecraft O/Os do not need to be familiar with the Spaceflight Safety Handbook
since CARA or JSC FOD will perform all actions on their behalf.

(See Section 7 in this document for USSPACECOM contact information including Uniform
Resource Locators (URLs) to obtain products. See Sections 5.1 through 5.3 for details of some
topics from the Spaceflight Safety Handbook to provide end-to-end understanding of the
conjunction assessment process.)
Commercial conjunction assessment providers, often using space catalogs assembled from
private sector space tracking assets, are now an available resource for O/Os who wish to obtain
conjunction assessment services. NASA encourages the use of validated commercial conjunction
assessment services when they can augment the existing USSPACECOM capabilities. NASA
recommends that all O/Os avail themselves of the USSPACECOM conjunction assessment
service at a minimum as an adjunct to a commercially procured service. (See Section 6.1 for
additional information about orbital data for conjunction assessment; Appendix J, which outlines
conjunction risk assessment tools validation procedures; and Appendix L, which addresses the
question of the use of commercial SSA data in conjunction risk assessment.)
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Obtain a space-track.org account.
B. Become familiar with the Spaceflight Safety Handbook contents.
C. Use USSPACECOM conjunction assessment service as a minimum for screenings,
even if additional commercial data or services are used.
SSN Tracking Functionality Description
The Space Surveillance Network (SSN), a global sensor network made up of optical telescopes
and radars, is used to collect the tracking observations that are processed to maintain the High
Accuracy Catalog (HAC) of on-orbit space objects. Figure 3-1 shows the current locations of the
member sensors.

Figure 3-1 Locations and Types of SSN Sensors and Nodes 4
Because most sensors have other purposes in addition to collecting data for SSA, tracking data
cannot be simply requested and obtained on demand. Objects are placed in tasking categories,
and a list of objects to attempt to track by category is sent to each sensor, which then sorts the list
to determine which requests are feasible given the sensor‚Äôs calculation of the probability of
detection of the requested satellite and competing activities.
Priority is given to military operational needs and special needs within conjunction assessment
such as human space flight. If a USSPACECOM conjunction assessment operator determines
that there is insufficient tracking data available to create a good orbit determination solution for
an object, the operator may attempt to obtain additional data by increasing the priority of the
object or by tasking additional sensors to track it. Sensors may not be able to track an object due
to geometric and power constraints, weather, equipment outages, and other exigencies.

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
The USSPACECOM process is different from a commercial process in which a vendor is
compensated directly for the tracking of an object with the flexibility of being able to obtain
additional data if more funds are available to support the request. Because of the time required to
collect additional data on an object of concern using the USSPACECOM process, it is
recommended that O/Os provide a significant length of ephemeris prediction (including planned
maneuvers) to USSPACECOM for screening. This screening duration allows time for
USSPACECOM conjunction assessment operators to increase tasking for identified secondary
objects with insufficient orbit determination solutions, and thus to enable the best Pc to be
computed for use in conjunction risk assessment decisions. (See Section 6.1 for a more detailed
discussion of these issues.)
To address this topic, the following specific practice is recommended:
A. Provide seven (7) days of predicted ephemeris (including maneuvers) to
USSPACECOM for screening for LEO spacecraft, and provide 14 days for other
Earth orbits; e.g., High Earth Orbit (HEO)/Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO).
USSPACECOM Conjunction Assessment Screening Timeline and Process
Personnel at the USSPACECOM facility at Dahlgren Naval Base currently perform screenings
of protected assets against the entire HAC once per day at a minimum and up to three times per
day every day. Screenings are performed using both the ephemeris data that O/Os share (which
include planned maneuvers for the asset) as well as the SSN-derived orbit determination solution
for the asset (which does not consider predicted maneuvers).
Results from the screenings, in the form of Conjunction Data Messages (CDMs), are posted to
space-track.org for customers with accounts. Entities without accounts who have provided an
email address to USSPACECOM may receive basic prediction information by email if an
emergency is detected.
Special/off-cycle screenings can be requested per the guidance in the Spaceflight Safety
Handbook. It is important for safety of flight for all spacecraft operators to ensure that there are
no large latencies or gaps in the process as uncertainties in the propagated orbit continue to grow
over time. For instance, submitting an ephemeris for screening today at noon that has an epoch of
today at 0 hours means that the data is already 12 hours old. If it then takes 8 hours to screen that
data and another 2 hours to analyze the results, the data will be very old indeed. Ensure that the
data screened is for a future time and is analyzed and acted upon before it becomes stale. (See
Section 6.2 for more information.)

To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Provide at least one ephemeris per day to be screened and three ephemerides per
day in the lower-drag LEO regime (perigee height less than 500 km).
B. Determine whether the O/O‚Äôs process for obtaining screening results and
performing conjunction risk assessment aligns with the timeline of the
USSPACECOM process. If the timelines do not align in such a way as to enable
timely and efficient screening support, pursue a rearrangement of the O/O‚Äôs
process to minimize data latency and optimize screening efficiency.
Data Sharing with Other O/Os
To facilitate communication between operators to mitigate a close approach, USSPACECOM
maintains a list of contacts for each asset. Maintaining this list of contacts is critical so that
someone can always be reached. Data sharing is further facilitated though the use of standard
formats and coordinate frames. (See Section 6.4 for a more thorough treatment.)
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Populate and maintain the point of contact section on space-track.org with your
operations contact data. Be sure that the operations contact can be reached 24/7
due to time zone differences between operators and the immediate nature of
certain conjunction assessment emergencies.
B. Use standard ephemeris, CDM, and maneuver notification formats defined by the
Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS).
SSA Sharing Agreements
USSPACECOM/J535, SSA Data Sharing Branch, negotiates SSA sharing agreements, which
establish the parameters within which data will be exchanged by the signing parties to facilitate
ongoing cooperation and advance space flight safety. These agreements are useful because they
substantially expand the types of data products that can be received over the default products
provided to entities without agreements.
Any member of the space community, including satellite operators, launching agencies,
commercial service providers, and research/academic institutions, that wishes more and more
frequent SSA products than are provided through a generic space-track.org account should
contact USSPACECOM. (See Section 7 of this document for contact information.)
U.S. Government organizations and their contractors have implied agreements and do not need
to pursue a separate formal arrangement with USSPACECOM.

NASA Partnership with USSPACECOM
Since the development of the HAC and its use in routine conjunction assessment screenings,
NASA has partnered with USSPACECOM and its predecessor organizations. That partnership
currently includes special, dedicated conjunction assessment screening support. The human
3.0 Conjunction Assessment: Past, Present, and Future

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
space flight program uses U.S. Air Force civilians for conjunction assessment screening support,
while NASA‚Äôs non-human space flight missions are supported by NASA contractors called
Orbital Safety Analysts (OSAs) who work on the operations floor in the VSFB operations center.
While both groups do essentially the same work with the same input data, NASA OSAs focus
specifically on NASA needs and can write scripts that are used to tailor the output data for use by
CARA.
Conjunction assessment is a 3-step process:
1. The first step is conjunction assessment ‚Äúscreening,‚Äù which involves computing the
predicted close approaches between the protected asset and the catalog of space objects.
This is the step performed at the USSPACECOM facility for mission customers, and
screening results are provided that describe predicted close approaches. Both the
USSPACECOM conjunction assessment cell and NASA OSAs perform this function.
2. The second step is conjunction ‚Äúrisk assessment,‚Äù in which the screening results are
analyzed to determine the level of risk posed by each predicted close approach and to
determine whether the predicted close approaches warrant additional investigation and,
ultimately, mitigation. This step is critical because not all predicted close approaches
require mitigation, and often close approaches require analysis to determine what action
is warranted. This step is not performed by USSPACECOM as it is a responsibility
allocated to O/Os or organizations that perform this activity on the O/O‚Äôs behalf. NASA
JSC FOD performs this function for human space flight program assets, and NASA
CARA performs this function for all other NASA spacecraft.
3. The third step, if required, is conjunction ‚Äúmitigation,‚Äù in which the O/O plans, and
perhaps executes, a collision avoidance maneuver or other mitigation solution to reduce
the collision risk to an acceptable level. This activity is allocated to the individual O/Os
although NASA CARA does provide some basic support tools to aid in the initial choice
of mitigation actions for its mission customers.
Because risk assessment requires different products and yields different analyses than screening,
it is important to consider the tools and processes required to assess risk properly and adequately.
For large constellations, the cadence of conjunctions and the consequence of a collision for the
proper operation of the constellation are both heightened. (See Section 6 for more detail on risk
assessment processes.)

3.0 Conjunction Assessment: Past, Present, and Future

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Develop a robust safety-of-flight process that includes both conjunction
assessment screening and risk assessment to inform close approach mitigation
decisions.
B. Large constellation operators should work with USSPACECOM pre-launch to
determine if variations from the standard approach are necessary and, if so, to
define a tailored screening process.
C. Large constellation operators should consider working with NASA to define a
risk assessment process. NASA is an experienced representative operator.
Including NASA in discussions regarding establishing a conjunction assessment
process will ensure that the process will work with most operators for risk
assessment purposes.

Conjunction Assessment in Cislunar Space
Significant investments by the U.S., China, other nations, and commercial companies in missions
to cislunar space between Earth and the Moon have highlighted the need for proper measures to
ensure the safety of the space environment in that regime. While cislunar space will remain ‚Äúbig‚Äù
for some time yet, popular locations and transit trajectories are likely to experience rapid growth,
requiring effective conjunction risk analysis to maintain safety. Implementing appropriate
measures for spacecraft will ensure readiness to perform effective conjunction risk assessment as
cislunar space traffic increases.
In November 2022, the White House National Science & Technology Policy Council released
the National Cislunar Science & Technology Strategy, an interagency strategy to guide
developments across a spectrum of emerging areas in the cislunar ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù (National
Cislunar Science & Technology Strategy, 2022). Several objectives espoused in this document
pertain to Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and space safety, including the following:
‚Ä¢

Develop technical foundations of best practices for safe cislunar space flight operations.

‚Ä¢

Develop an integrated cislunar object catalog.

‚Ä¢

Develop procedures for publicly sharing cislunar SSA data as well as navigation and
space flight safety support in cislunar space.

‚Ä¢

Ensure that capabilities for U.S. Government cislunar operations are scalable and
interoperable with systems operated by private and international actors.

(For additional details and context, refer to the Strategy document.)
Key Goals
For the purpose of outlining best practices for conjunction risk assessment, key goals center on
sharing data and ensuring interoperability. These goals can be achieved through the delivery of

3.0 Conjunction Assessment: Past, Present, and Future

12

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
standardized file formats and content, along with the use of consistent trajectory models and
coordinate frame definitions.
The use of consistent trajectory models and coordinate frame definitions is best realized by
conforming to the recommendations in the recently released NASA Technical Publication
‚ÄúAstrodynamics Convention and Modeling Reference for Lunar, Cislunar, and Libration Point
Orbits‚Äù (Folta et al. 2022). This document details coordinate and time systems, numerical
integration techniques, and trajectory modeling of three-body systems at different levels of
fidelity appropriate for mission design and navigation of spacecraft well beyond geosynchronous
orbit (GEO). A cislunar conjunction risk assessment best practice is to conform to the
astrodynamics conventions and modeling recommendations of this NASA technical publication
to enforce consistency across ephemerides from different sources, thereby enabling more
accurate conjunction assessments.
The goal of standardizing file formats and content has been addressed by DOD, NASA, and
academia through a Cis-Lunar SSA Technical Steering Group led by the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency (NGA). The Steering Group has produced a draft document outlining an
enhanced message set that enables communication of space object catalog and observational data
for the cislunar regime (Butt 2021).5 The recommended set covers object state and covariance
information in the catalog content message and sensor observations in the tracking data message.
These formats overcome shortcomings of the current SSA message set that prohibits accurate
expression of cislunar data and also update features of the current set that have not evolved with
advances in SSA since their inception in the 1960s.
A cislunar conjunction risk assessment best practice is to conform to these recommendations
when developing SSA architectures to support cislunar missions.
Conjunction Screening Process
Sharing of standardized ephemeris and covariance data is the intent of the current practice of
Earth orbiter owner/operators (O/Os) delivering files to conjunction screening providers such as
the U.S. Space Force 18th Space Defense Squadron (18 SDS), 19th Space Defense Squadron (19
SDS), or CARA for use in computing a probability of collision (Pc) during encounters. However,
cislunar conjunction assessment currently has no catalog of cislunar objects with independent
trajectory and covariance solutions and so requires a different screening process.
NASA currently performs conjunction assessment around Mars, the Moon, and Sun/Earth
libration points through the Multimission Automated Deepspace Conjunction Assessment
Process (MADCAP) based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). More information about
MADCAP and related processes is available on the organization‚Äôs website:
https://www.nasa.gov/cara/madcap and in the document Tarzi et al. 2022. Spacecraft operators,
including for non-NASA and even non-partner international spacecraft, deliver ephemerides to
the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) Service Preparation Subsystem (SPS) portal, through

3.0 Conjunction Assessment: Past, Present, and Future

13

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
which MADCAP can access them. MADCAP assesses conjunction risk based on Pc if a
covariance is provided, or (if necessary) via typical radial and timing prediction uncertainties
provided by the respective mission navigation teams. These uncertainties are fit to polynomials
in time and mapped to the relative node of the two orbits to assess the risk of collision at the
crossing. However, as described in Tarzi et al. 2022, MADCAP has implemented the capability
to compute two-dimensional Pc (2D-Pc) when given ephemerides with covariance. When
potentially risky conjunctions are discovered, notifications and conjunction event data are
forwarded to both satellites‚Äô operations teams, who then are expected to work with each other to
determine if a mitigation action is necessary and, if so, execute it. JPL‚Äôs MADCAP Team will
facilitate the decision process if the operations teams cannot agree on a course of action.
Regarding the lack of a centralized catalog of cislunar objects, that is currently in work by
19 SDS. In fact, many cislunar conjunction assessment capabilities are evolving with the
potential for significant advances in deep space tracking, trajectory modeling, and ephemeris
sharing interfaces. Because many of these advances are still in development, the baseline for
conjunction risk assessment must rely on ephemeris and covariance produced by the O/O rather
than catalog screening.
As such, the O/O should deliver a CCSDS Orbit Ephemeris Message (OEM) formatted
ephemeris with covariance to both space-track.org and to the DSN SPS portal. This will allow
access to the trajectory and its uncertainty for screening by both 19 SDS (through SpaceTrack)
and MADCAP (through SPS).
The CCSDS format is the current industry standard, aligning with the standardization goal
outlined above. Because a non-cooperative orbit solution for cislunar spacecraft is not currently
available, inclusion of the covariance in the O/O ephemeris file is essential to allow computation
of the probability of collision. Establishing the best practice of O/Os providing accurate
trajectory and covariance for their spacecraft in cislunar space to current ephemeris interfaces
sets the stage for effective conjunction screenings as operational advances continue to be made in
the cislunar regime.
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Owner/operators should conform to recommendations in the NASA Technical
Publication ‚ÄúAstrodynamics Convention and Modeling Reference for Lunar, Cislunar,
and Libration Point Orbits.‚Äù
B. Cislunar mission support entities (sensors, catalog maintainers, etc.) should conform to
the enhanced SSA message set (Butt 2021) when creating cislunar SSA architectures.
C. Owner/operators should maintain accurate orbit determination solutions and predicted
covariance for objects in cislunar space.
D. Owner/operators should deliver predicted ephemeris with covariance in the CCSDS
format to space-track.org and to the DSN SPS portal.

4.0 Spacecraft and Constellation Design
Safety of flight is an integral aspect of satellite space operations and should be considered as part
of design decisions to enable cost- and mission-effective solutions so that potential impacts to
other operators in the space environment can be avoided. Specific design areas for which the
consideration of on-orbit safety issues is appropriate include:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

orbit selection,
spacecraft ascent and disposal activities,
sensor trackability of the spacecraft,
spacecraft reliability,
capabilities for ephemeris generation, and
capabilities for risk assessment and mitigation.

Each of these items is treated in more detail in this section.

Ascent to/Disposal from the Constellation‚Äôs Operational Orbit
Safety-of-flight issues may be considerable when related to the ascent from the launch injection
point to the satellite‚Äôs on-station position or to the descent to an orbit from which disposal/reentry can be accomplished directly. Typical ascent and descent trajectory design using now
common electric propulsion or low-thrust chemical propulsion can take months to accomplish,
potentially passing through highly populated regions of space along the way. For large
constellations, the amount of nearly continuous transiting satellite traffic could be especially
large as old satellites pass out of service and replacement satellites are added.
All missions should plan for orbit disposal to reduce long-term orbital debris. Reducing the
number of inactive space objects minimizes the probability of generating debris through orbital
collisions, and the fastest disposal option should be pursued; for example, existing large
constellations are promptly deorbiting end-of life spacecraft. The U.S. Government has
established Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices (ODMSP) including for post-mission
disposal.6 NASA missions are required by NPR 8715.6 to comply with NASA Standard 871914B, Process for Limiting Orbital Debris, which defines how NASA implements the ODMSP.
During ascent and descent, a spacecraft will pass by other assets that are already on orbit. Some
but not all of those may be maneuverable. The ascending/descending spacecraft that is equipped
to maneuver needs to yield the right-of-way to existing on-orbit assets by performing risk
mitigation maneuvers or ascent/descent trajectory alterations.
Special caution is needed to protect humans on orbit. If the ascent or descent trajectory will pass
through the ISS altitude, operators should coordinate with the NASA JSC FOD to avoid perigeelowering approaches that pose persistent and problematic orbital crossings with ISS and other
human space flight assets.

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Perform a study to compute the number of expected close approaches anticipated
during ascent and descent as well as the imputed additional satellite reliability that
will be required to meet satellite disposal requirements at the chosen operational
orbit.
B. If the results of the study show a large burden, consider choosing a different
mission orbit with a lower burden.
C. All missions should review and follow the ODMSP guidance standards.
D. When practicable, pursue active disposal using the fastest disposal option
available.
E. Recognize that transiting spacecraft should yield way to on-station spacecraft and
thus take responsibility for any conjunction risk mitigation maneuvers or transient
trajectory alterations that may be required.
F. When planning descent using thrusters, if not planning an approach of circularorbit altitude reduction, coordinate with the NASA JSC TOPO to ensure that
perigee-lowering approaches do not present persistent and problematic orbital
crossings with the ISS and other human space flight assets.

General Orbit Selection: Debris Object Density
Space debris is not uniformly distributed about the Earth. Because most of the present space
debris is generated from a relatively small number of satellite collisions or explosions, the orbital
parameters of these collided or exploded satellites determine where the large debris fields reside.
For example, the debris object density is much greater in the 750-900 km altitude band than in
other parts of LEO. If possible, this region is one to avoid as a destination orbit since a larger
number of serious satellite conjunctions with debris objects can be expected. An orbit that results
in a high number of close approaches can lead to the need to perform many maneuvers that may
not fully mitigate the risk of close approach. Spacecraft that cannot maneuver will operate at
higher risk of debris creation, effectively presenting additional risk to other operators.
Orbit selection should be informed by a study to determine expected conjunction rates; that is,
the expected number of lifetime conjunction risk mitigation maneuvers and the amount of
satellite fuel needed to permit the number of desired years on orbit. Published results by NASA
CARA are available and can be consulted to obtain first-order high-interest event density
information. (See Appendix F for more information and examples.) Use this information to
assess the mission impact for conjunction risk mitigation maneuvers, given the expected lifetime
of each satellite (e.g., additional propellant required, impacts on data collection).

4.0 Spacecraft and Constellation Design

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Include considerations of orbital debris density when selecting candidate mission
orbits. Debris density diagrams, indexed by object size, are published by the
NASA Orbital Debris Program Office (ODPO). (See Appendix G for more
information and examples.)
B. When choosing from the final set of candidate orbits, perform a conjunction
frequency analysis to determine the number of conjunction high-interest events
per spacecraft per year that can be expected in each of the proposed orbital areas.

Vehicle- and Constellation-Specific Orbit Selection: Spacecraft
Colocation
While there is a process used by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to ensure that
spacecraft locations are deconflicted from a radio frequency perspective, there is no similar
centralized process for ensuring that spacecraft locations are deconflicted from a location
perspective. This gap has resulted in spacecraft injecting into their planned mission orbit only to
find another spacecraft already in or very near that location (colocated), which causes close
approaches that then have to be mitigated, potentially very frequently, over the whole mission
lifetime.
Another similar problem is that of systematic or repeating conjunctions in which a spacecraft has
multiple repeated close approaches on successive orbits with another object over a long period of
time; for example, when using electric propulsion to move slowly through a congested area. Two
actively maintained spacecraft with very similar orbits can present a permanent recurring
collision hazard because both spacecraft can be planning future maneuvers that result in a
collision if not coordinated. Therefore, active coordination for every maneuver is required to
prevent the execution of simultaneous maneuvers that could create a collision.
Due to the lack of centralized coordination, it is incumbent upon individual operators to protect
themselves and the space environment by performing their own colocation analysis. The goal
would be to prevent choosing a location already occupied by another spacecraft, or, if that is not
possible, to work with the other operator before launch to devise a strategy to share the space.
Colocation situations can often be ameliorated through relatively small changes to the planned
orbits during the design phase. For NASA missions, CARA can perform this analysis using the
current USSPACECOM catalog data. (See Appendix H for more information and examples.) For
non-NASA missions, CARA will make their software tool available via public release.
In performing the analysis, it is not necessary to consider proximity to objects that are not
maneuverable (debris, rocket body, dead spacecraft) since the non-maneuverable object will pass
through the area under the control of non-conservative forces such as atmospheric drag and not
present a future issue for the (largely) static orbital parameters of the asset that is maintaining its
orbit using maneuvers.

4.0 Spacecraft and Constellation Design

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. During orbit selection, perform an orbit colocation analysis to determine whether
any of the proposed orbits is likely to create systematic conjunctions with existing
actively maintained satellites.
B. If the orbit colocation analysis identifies systematic conjunctions, consider
modifying the proposed orbit(s) slightly to eliminate this possibility. Optimizing
orbit placement may be appropriate.
C. If the selected orbit is likely to present systematic conjunctions with a pre-existing
spacecraft, then coordinate with the other operator(s) to arrange a process to
coordinate maneuver plans routinely during the life of the mission.

Launch-Related Conjunction Assessment
Launch Collision Avoidance (Launch COLA or LCOLA) is the evaluation of a particular launch
trajectory to determine whether the launch assembly, following this trajectory, will produce any
close approaches with other space objects. LCOLA is sometimes expanded to include more
indirect analyses to ensure that launch offscourings (rocket bodies, fairings, etc.) do not produce
close approaches with other objects during the first three days after launch, after which they can
be presumed to be cataloged and thus handled by the usual on-orbit conjunction assessment
methods.
LCOLA requirements are governed by the individual launch range or launch licensing agency.
Requirements are in the form of stand-off distances Pc depending on whether the on-orbit
conjuncting asset is a piece of debris, operational payload, or human space flight mission.
Examples of the current requirements are 200 km stand-off distance or 1E-6 Pc between the
object to be launched and human space flight assets and 25 km or 1E-5 Pc between the object to
be launched and non-human space flight operational payloads. In practice, LCOLA covers
launched objects from the time they reach 150 km through three hours. Launch times found in
violation of these requirements are enforced as launch hold periods by the respective wing
commanders.
A large study conducted by NASA (Hejduk et al. 2014) questioned the added value of LCOLA,
given the uncertainties typical of most predicted launch trajectories. However, recent
improvements in the fidelity of these predicted trajectories have made the LCOLA enterprise
potentially more meaningful, suggesting that the situation may need to be reevaluated.
The period between when traditional LCOLA ends and when an on-orbit asset can mitigate a risk
using standard on-orbit conjunction assessment methods is called the COLA gap. The O/O
should ensure that newly launched objects and their detritus will not come into conjunction with
protected assets during the COLA gap (i.e., until the 18 and 19 SDS can catalog the new
object(s) so it is available for conjunction assessment screening). Such analyses should consider
not just the predicted nominal launch injection but the expected (up to three-sigma) launch
dispersions.

4.0 Spacecraft and Constellation Design

18

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Specific criteria defining COLA gap launch cutouts do not exist since they are dependent on both
what is being launched and the capabilities of the protected on-orbit asset. For example, ISS
needs 36 hours for the COLA gap, which allows 24 hours for 18 and 19 SDS to track the launch
objects and then 12 hours for ISS to assess the risk and mitigate if required. Other assets might
require more time to close this risk gap. The methodology for this risk assessment can be a standoff distance phasing analysis, nodal separation and in-track screening, or a probability density
model. Note that this analysis is typically performed by Aerospace7 for DOD missions and the
NASA Launch Services Program for NASA missions. These organizations can be consulted for
details on the analysis techniques and criteria, which are also listed in Appendix Q (Hametz and
Beaver 2013; Jenkin et al. 2020). NASA JSC FOD can also be consulted for analysis methods
and to obtain details on the assets that could be at risk for each specific launch.
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Protect human space flight assets from close approaches during the COLA gap
using stand-off distance or statistical measures.
B. Conform to additional LCOLA requirements that the launch range may impose.

Spacecraft Trackability
Effective conjunction assessment requires an accurate orbital state. Accurate orbital state data
requires tracking data to maintain a comprehensive space catalog available to all space operators.
The USSPACECOM catalog serves this purpose and uses the data collected by the SSN.
Because even active spacecraft become debris after their end-of-life and therefore need tracking
to obtain an orbit solution, all launched satellites need to be acquirable and trackable by the SSN
from deployment until their demise so that they can be cataloged and maintained using SSN
capabilities alone. Launching an untrackable spacecraft increases risk to all operators.
Objects are trackable if they have a large enough radar or optical cross section to be tracked by at
least two SSN sensor assets. Analytical evaluations of trackability consider both object size and
material properties, so there is no absolute size threshold that is determinative. But as a rule of
thumb, satellites need to have characteristic dimensions of 10 cm in each major dimension for
spacecraft with perigee less than 2000 km and greater than 50 cm in each major dimension for
spacecraft with perigee greater than 2000 km.
If a satellite exceeds the above dimensions, then there is a reasonable expectation of its being
tracked by the existing SSN, and typically no further concern with trackability is needed. If a
satellite is smaller than the above dimensions, then additional arrangements should be made to
see to its orbital maintenance should its onboard navigation fail. Such arrangements could
include an agreement with a commercial SSA company to provide tracking and construct a
predicted ephemeris until re-entry or to add a trackability enhancement or autonomously
powered beacon device to allow the satellite‚Äôs position to be determined for the whole of its

orbital life. For objects that will regularly occupy a large number of altitudes, such as a HEO
object, special examination of the situation is required. For example, the object might be
trackable at the lower altitudes but not the higher ones, and the orbit might be eccentric enough
and with low enough perigee that good orbital modeling will require tracking at both apogee and
perigee; in such a case, the larger spacecraft dimension would need to be met to guarantee
trackability along the whole of the orbit.
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Through selection of physical design and materials, ensure that the satellite is
trackable by SSN from deployment until demise.
a. For spacecraft with perigee heights less than 2000 km, the spacecraft should
have characteristic dimensions of at least 10 cm in each major dimension.
b. For spacecraft with perigee heights greater than 2000 km, the spacecraft
should have characteristic dimensions of at least 50 cm in each major
dimension.
c. If the spacecraft cannot meet these dimension constraints, use a proven
detectability enhancement.
d. For spacecraft having orbits that span a large range of altitudes, ensure that the
spacecraft is trackable at all altitudes.

Spacecraft Reliability
Studies related to active debris removal strategies have shown that the greatest contributor to
long-term space debris growth is derelict spacecraft left on orbit. Such spacecraft produce
opportunities for collision with smaller debris objects that cannot be mitigated, which will then
generally produce large amounts of debris. So, it is important to ensure that spacecraft survive
until they can be disposed of by using appropriate disposal as described in the OMDSP and by
ensuring that the probability of successful post-mission disposal meets or exceeds 99%.
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Ensure that spacecraft reliability is high enough that the likelihood of each
spacecraft remaining fully functional until it can be disposed of meets or
exceeds 99%.
B. Reassess the 99% analysis whenever the underlying assumptions change; for
example, extending operations beyond design life or failures in key systems.

Development of Capabilities for Ephemeris Generation and
Conjunction Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Conjunction assessment capabilities are needed immediately after launch. The software and
process components of the conjunction risk assessment and mitigation capabilities should be
fully developed and tested before launch including elements of both the flight hardware and the
ground system.
4.0 Spacecraft and Constellation Design

20

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Three main capabilities should be developed:
1. Predicted ephemeris capability. Predicted ephemeris data that can be shared with other
O/Os is needed to assess the potential for collisions between space objects. The current
U.S. Government conjunction assessment process uses two predicted ephemeris solutions
for the asset: one generated using non-cooperative SSN tracking data and one shared with
18 and 19 SDS by the O/O. For active, maneuverable spacecraft, the O/O-generated
ephemeris is often the best representation of the future position because the O/O usually
has access to more cooperative tracking data to feed the orbit-determination process (for
example, from onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers); has an accurate
model of the spacecraft‚Äôs drag coefficient and frontal area; and, most importantly, can
model planned future maneuvers in the predicted trajectory. To enable the conjunction
assessment process, predicted ephemerides must be furnished frequently, span an
appropriate period of predictive time, employ point spacing close enough to enable
interpolation, provide a full state (position and velocity) for each ephemeris point, and
provide a realistic 6 x 6 covariance matrix (with both variance and covariance terms) for
each ephemeris point. (See Appendix I for more details about covariance realism
characterization and evaluation.)
2. Risk assessment capability. The results of satellite conjunction screening analyses are
sent from USSPACECOM to O/Os in the form of CDMs that contain the states,
covariances, and amplifying orbit determination information for the primary and
secondary object at the Time of Closest Approach (TCA). These messages, however, are
only a notification of a predicted potential close approach. For a robust safety-of-flight
process, additional risk assessment analysis is needed to determine whether the close
approach warrants mitigation. Conjunction risk assessment tools are needed to perform
this risk assessment, which includes calculation of Pc and other relevant information such
as expected collision consequence (addressed in Appendix O) and whether the state and
covariance information is sufficiently accurate to subtend the risk assessment process
(addressed in Appendix P). For conjunction events in which the Pc exceeds a severity
threshold, mitigation action planning is necessary to plan a mitigation option that will
lower the Pc to below an acceptable threshold, usually conducted with the aid of tradespace plots that give conjunction Pc reduction as a function of spacecraft trajectory
modification size and execution time. Validating these tools is important well before
flight. (See Appendix J.) Some commercial vendors offer risk assessment services.
Spacecraft operators who choose to purchase risk assessment services should make these
arrangements well before launch to ensure adequate time for testing and development
of a corresponding process for choosing a mitigation option given the risk assessment
results received from the service.
3. Mitigation capability. A spacecraft can mitigate a close approach in several ways:
‚Ä¢

Propulsive maneuvers (e.g., performed using thrusters).

‚Ä¢

Attitude changes to take advantage of altered drag coefficients from altered
frontal areas to effect a relative velocity change between the two objects.

4.0 Spacecraft and Constellation Design

21

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
‚Ä¢

Changing the spacecraft attitude to present a minimal frontal area to the relative
velocity vector to minimize the likelihood of collision.

‚Ä¢

Sharing ephemeris data with the operator of the other spacecraft involved in the
close approach so that they can perform an avoidance maneuver.

Because the design of the spacecraft and/or ground system needs to accommodate the
ability to perform these actions, spacecraft operators should choose a mitigation option
when they select their mission orbit and ensure that the capability is built into the system
appropriately in time for testing and use.
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Develop and implement a capability to generate and share accurate predicted
spacecraft ephemerides including any planned maneuvers. (See Section 3.1 for a
discussion of ephemeris sharing for screening. See Section 6.2 for specific
guidance on ephemeris generation frequency, length, point spacing, formatting,
and contents.)
B. Determine during spacecraft design what risk mitigation approaches are possible
for the spacecraft. While trajectory modification via thrusting maneuver is the
most common approach, other approaches such as differential drag orbit
modification are possible.
C. Develop and implement or arrange to acquire a capability to process CDMs and to
compute conjunction risk assessment parameters such as the Pc.
D. Develop and implement or arrange to acquire a risk analysis capability to select
mitigation actions that will lower the Pc for dangerous conjunctions to a userselected value.
E. Validate conjunction assessment tools well before flight, typically 6-12 months
prior.

5.0 Pre-Launch Preparation and Early Launch Activities
The pre-launch and launch/early orbit phase of a satellite‚Äôs lifetime is the period during which
safety-related policy decisions are rendered and associated data interfaces established. Safetyrelated policy decisions carry forward as precedent and actual operational arrangement to form
the O/O‚Äôs safety posture over the satellite‚Äôs orbital lifetime.
Many pre-launch activities such as establishing interfaces, data sharing agreements, and a
Concept of Operations (CONOPS) require coordination. Other activities pertaining to the launch
and early orbit period such as outlining particular practices and reporting are needed to conduct
conjunction assessment activities during this phase of orbital life and to facilitate a smooth
transition into on-orbit conjunction assessment. Each activity is treated individually in this
section.

CONOPS Discussions and Arrangements with USSPACECOM
Pertaining to Launch Phase
A spacecraft‚Äôs journey from the launch facility to its on-station positioning in its service orbit is
complicated and open to mishaps that can damage both the launching spacecraft and other
spacecraft in proximity. The U.S. Government performs required activities in support of the
launch enterprise including cataloging the spacecraft and any other space objects, debris and
otherwise, related to the launch. To meet these responsibilities and provide a safe exercise of the
launch process, the spacecraft operator needs to execute several pre-launch activities and points
of coordination. This is best done by coordinating with USSPACECOM to discuss all the related
issues, exchange information, and generate a comprehensive launch and deployment plan so that
all affected agencies can exercise their proper roles.
First, early cataloging is extremely important to enable the conjunction assessment process to
protect all other on-orbit assets. To assist the cataloging function, all aspects of the launch
delivery and deployment methodology need to be fully documented and communicated to
USSPACECOM so that those performing the launch cataloging process know what to expect at
each point and can respond appropriately.
Aspects of the launch delivery that may affect cataloging and should be documented would
include the launch vehicle configuration (rocket versus air launch) and the launch phases
(parking orbits, transfer orbits, injection, and post-injection transiting to on-station locations).
The deployment methodology includes timing post-separation and number of objects deployed.
Examples of unusual deployment features that might create cataloging issues include highvelocity deployments, non-immediate deployments (i.e., subsequent deployment of a satellite
from one of the deployed satellites), and tethered satellites. Multiple nearly simultaneous
deployments are a challenge for tracking and will delay cataloging which in turn poses a safetyof-flight risk. Deployments should be spaced to allow acquisition of each object. For multiple
nearly simultaneous deployments, the expected range of deployment speeds and directions
should be provided.
5.0 Pre-Launch Preparation and Early Launch Activities

23

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Input for the R-15 launch form (launch plan and orbital parameters) should also be discussed
with USSPACECOM so that they may render any necessary clarification or aid. The launch
provider is responsible for completing and submitting the R-15 form; however, the O/O should
discuss the content with USSPACECOM well in advance of the launch. (See Appendix K for
more information.)
Second, detailed launch trajectory information for all launch objects needs to be submitted to
USSPACECOM with a Form-22 (on space-track.org) well before the launch date so that a
colocation and object avoidance analysis for the launch sequence can be conducted and, if
necessary, adjustments made to ensure safety. To avoid close approaches with the ISS and other
active spacecraft, it may be necessary to modify the launch sequence slightly and eliminate
certain launch times from the launch window. Launch providers frequently take responsibility
for these activities, but it is important for O/Os to be aware of the availability and benefits of this
service.
Third, to avoid any data transfer failures while the launch is in progress, the required exchange of
data between O/O and USSPACECOM during the launch process and the associated formats and
timelines need to be established, understood, and exercised prior to launch.
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Establish contact with USSPACECOM to describe and discuss all aspects of the
launch including delivery and deployment methodologies.
B. Space the deployment of multiple spacecraft in a way that enhances the ability of
USSPACECOM to quickly identify and differentiate the spacecraft using the
SSN.
C. Discuss the preparation of the R-15 launch form with USSPACECOM so that
they understand its contents and any implications for safety of flight.
D. Ensure that the launch provider submits the Form 22 and launch trajectory
information to USSPACECOM, including ephemerides for the powered flight
portions and orbital elements for the parking orbits, so that potential colocation
and deconfliction potentialities can be discovered.
E. Provide to USSPACECOM as soon as possible launch-related information (e.g.,
injection vectors and initial ephemerides for deployed spacecraft) that can be used
to assist with the cataloging process, especially to confirm the identity of launchrelated objects. Coordinate a satellite numbering scheme (potentially including
temporary satellite numbers) appropriate to the launch type and expected degree
of cataloging difficulty.
F. Coordinate with USSPACECOM any potential launch anomaly diagnostic
products that can be provided if issues arise during the launch and early orbit
sequence.

CONOPS Discussions and Arrangements with USSPACECOM
and NASA Pertaining to On-Orbit Mission Phase
USSPACECOM is required to maintain orbit determination solutions on all objects arising from
the launch as part of its military space object custody responsibilities. USSPACECOM also
provides conjunction assessment information to O/Os for safety of flight. In order for
USSPACECOM to maintain the catalog most easily for safety of flight for all, the O/O should
provide relevant details about its assets. The pre-launch period is the appropriate time to conduct
exchanges of information that facilitate these activities.
1. Provide operational contact information. It is important for the satellite operator to
provide operational point-of-contact information so that USSPACECOM can coordinate
spacecraft tracking, cataloging, identification, and provision of space flight safety data for
the satellite. Submitting this information allows expeditious contact if issues arise during
the launch and on-orbit periods of the satellite‚Äôs lifespan and provides the information
necessary for USSPACECOM to arrange for the delivery of basic space flight safety
services.
2. Provide information about satellite construction and operation. Basic information
about the satellite to be deployed, such as satellite dimensions, presence of deployable
structures (e.g., solar panels, antennae), satellite material properties, and expected
satellite regular attitude, needs to be communicated to USSPACECOM. These aspects of
satellite construction and operation affect trackability, and an understanding of these
construction features allows USSPACECOM to assemble a tracking approach, assign
appropriate sensors, and predict the regularity of attempted tracking success.
3. Provide satellite orbit maintenance strategy. The orbit maintenance strategy for the
satellite should be communicated, at least at a high level. Information such as the logic
for determining orbit maintenance maneuvers, the maneuver thruster technology, and the
frequency/size/duration of orbit maintenance burns will help USSPACECOM to set up
the orbit maintenance parameters properly for each satellite to perform the most reliable
orbit maintenance possible.
4. Provide the satellite flight control and navigation paradigm. Understanding the flight
control and navigation paradigm of the satellite is needed, especially whether a traditional
ground-control paradigm has been followed or whether autonomous navigation is used. If
the latter, the amount of ground-knowledge of satellite activities, such as whether there is
foreknowledge of maneuvers and an opportunity to override these maneuvers from the
ground before they are executed, is important to understand the degree to which the
satellite‚Äôs navigation can be manually influenced if necessary. In addition to setting
general expectations for the satellite‚Äôs flight dynamics, this information is helpful in
determining the degree of expected fidelity for regularly generated satellite O/O
ephemerides.

5.0 Pre-Launch Preparation and Early Launch Activities

To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Register the spacecraft with USSPACECOM using the Satellite Registration form
on space-track.org.
B. Provide USSPACECOM with basic construction and mission information about
the satellite such as stowed dimensions; deployable structures such as solar
panels, antennae, booms, including all their (rough) dimensions; satellite material
properties and colors; regular satellite attitude; and registered operational radio
frequencies.
C. Provide USSPACECOM with a basic overview of the satellite‚Äôs orbit
maintenance strategy including the paradigm for determining when orbit
maintenance maneuvers are required; the maneuver technology used (as this
relates to burn duration and expected accuracy); and the frequency, duration, and
magnitude of typical burns.
D. Provide USSPACECOM with an understanding of the flight control and
navigation paradigm, principally whether a ground-based control approach is
followed or some degree of (or full) autonomous control is used. If the satellite
control does include some autonomous flight dynamics or control features,
indicate how much (if any) foreknowledge ground controllers have of
autonomous maneuver actions, the amount of information that is communicated
to the ground both before and after the maneuver (e.g., maneuver time, delta-V,
direction), and whether ground-based overrides are possible.

CONOPS Discussions and Arrangements with USSPACECOM
and NASA Pertaining to Conjunction Assessment
On-orbit conjunction assessment is needed to protect the satellite and keep valuable orbital
corridors free of debris pollution and sustainable for the indefinite future. The screening process
is the first step in completing a risk analysis for a potential conjunction.
Conjunction assessment screenings typically use O/O ephemerides as a statement of the primary
object‚Äôs position. Ephemeris formats, delivery mechanisms, and screening timetables need to be
coordinated with the screening provider. The screening provider should use this information to
monitor the satellite‚Äôs projected position over time and identify potential conjunctions. The O/O
needs to choose which screening service provider will be used (i.e., the USSPACECOM free
service, a validated commercial conjunction assessment service, or both) and establish a robust
interface prior to launch.
USSPACECOM currently provides a free conjunction assessment service that performs
conjunction assessment screenings on behalf of an O/O and sends proximity warnings (CDMs)
for each situation in which the distance between the O/O‚Äôs satellite and another cataloged object
is smaller than a set threshold. These messages give O/Os the data they need to assess the
collision likelihood of a particular conjunction and, if necessary, plan and take mitigative action.
As noted in Section 3.1, NASA recommends at a minimum using the USSPACECOM
5.0 Pre-Launch Preparation and Early Launch Activities

26

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
conjunction assessment service, which can be augmented with validated commercial conjunction
assessment services when desired. (See the USSPACECOM Spaceflight Safety Handbook for
additional information regarding the USSPACECOM conjunction assessment service.)
Commercial providers should provide equivalent support and data formats. Many commercial
conjunction assessment services work from the USSPACECOM conjunction assessment data
and not from separate or unique commercial SSA data.
Based on satellite orbit and mission characteristics, a screening volume size will need to be
assigned. (See the USSPACECOM Spaceflight Safety Handbook for more details.) The
screening volume is the physical volume (generally an ellipsoid) that is ‚Äúflown‚Äù along the
primary‚Äôs orbit during the screening process, with any objects found within this volume
considered to be conjunctions and associated CDMs generated. If a commercial conjunction
assessment provider is selected, the O/O will need to work directly with the provider to discuss
the type, timing, and format of the information needed. (See Appendix L for Information about
how NASA validates and uses commercial data.)
USSPACECOM distributes CDMs through space-track.org. An O/O needs to register on spacetrack.org and provide contact information to USSPACECOM to receive the basic level of
CDMs. If desired, a test instantiation of space-track.org is available to allow O/Os to practice
generating, receiving, and processing the conjunction assessment data products.
Finally, a formal Orbital Data Request (ODR) for any of the desired USSPACECOM-generated
conjunction assessment information beyond the most basic products will need to be submitted to
USSPACECOM and adjudicated before information exchange can begin. An ODR form is a
method to request data and services beyond the basic ones. The form and instructions for filling
it out are posted on space-track.org. Non-U.S. Government entities are strongly encouraged to
sign SSA sharing agreements with USSPACECOM, which expedites the ODR process. For
NASA missions, ODRs are sent to CARA and JSC FOD, who submit them on behalf of the
mission. ODRs are used to request permission to redistribute USSPACECOM data to other
entities, obtain specialized one-time analyses, and make other specific requests.
Large constellations may require special considerations such as quantity or timeframe of data
used for screening and risk analysis. NASA has considerable operational experience with
conjunction risk assessment and has assisted previous large constellation operators in designing a
conjunction risk assessment process that scales appropriately.

To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Decide whether the USSPACECOM free service, a validated commercial
conjunction assessment service, or both will be used by the mission.
B. Establish a service with the selected service provider.
C. Implement a SSA sharing agreement with USSPACECOM to receive advanced
data support and services.
D. Through the registration of the satellite with USSPACECOM, begin the process
of arranging for conjunction analysis data exchange including O/O ephemerides,
maneuver notification reports, and CDMs. USSPACECOM uses the spacetrack.org account as the mechanism for product exchange.
E. If needed, complete an Orbital Data Request (ODR) form to arrange for delivery
of USSPACECOM advanced conjunction analysis products.
F. For large constellations, coordinate with NASA and the screening provider to
identify and address any special considerations.

In situ Launch Products and Processes
Once liftoff is achieved, the foci become those of a safe journey to the final on-station
destinations of the spacecraft and the efficient performance of the launch cataloging process. To
determine whether the launch is nominal and has deposited its spacecraft as expected, the initial
injection vector should be provided to USSPACECOM as soon as it is available. Additionally,
once initial contact has been made with each spacecraft and initial position information has been
downlinked, the generation and forwarding to USSPACECOM of associated predicted
ephemerides is very helpful in properly identifying the new spacecraft and, in some cases,
finding them in the first place. Finally, to render any desired anomaly support and to assume the
appropriate conjunction assessment posture for non-functional spacecraft, it is important to
forward (or update on space-track.org) spacecraft status information, especially in the era of
‚Äúdisposable‚Äù satellites in which infant mortality is higher.

5.0 Pre-Launch Preparation and Early Launch Activities

To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. To aid in satellite tracking and identification, provide injection vector(s) to
USSPACECOM as soon as they are available.
B. To assist in spacecraft identification for the cataloging process and provide
general awareness among all O/Os, generate and forward predicted ephemerides
for the spacecraft to USSPACECOM and publish the ephemerides (and all
subsequent ephemeris updates) publicly as soon as contact is established with
each deployed spacecraft.
C. If USSPACECOM has issued TLEs for launched objects, notify USSPACECOM
of the TLE and object number associated with your spacecraft.
D. Provide early reporting to USSPACECOM of any spacecraft failures or other
operational difficulties, both to obtain any available anomaly support and to
assign the appropriate conjunction assessment approach to the spacecraft (i.e.,
inactive and thus handled in a manner equivalent to a debris object).
E. If using a commercial provider, make sure it has access to information from items
A-D.

6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance
For nearly all spacecraft, the on-orbit phase of their life cycle is the longest, meaning that the
conjunction assessment practices and CONOPS in place during this phase will have the greatest
impact on the satellite‚Äôs overall risk exposure.
As explained in Section 3, the conjunction assessment process as presently structured comprises
three phases:
1. Conjunction assessment screenings identify close approaches between a protected
asset, called the primary satellite, and any other space objects, called (from the vantage
point of the primary) ‚Äúsecondaries.‚Äù
2. Conjunction risk assessment examines each of the close approaches produced by the
screening activity to determine which may represent dangerous situations and therefore
require a mitigation action.
3. Conjunction mitigation constructs a mitigation action, usually a trajectory change for
the primary object, that will both reduce the collision risk of the close approach to an
acceptable level and not create any new high-risk conjunction events.
Before any of these three activities can take place, certain satellite data and position information
needs to be produced and made available to the conjunction assessment process.
These four aspects of conjunction assessment (required input data and the three phases of the
conjunction assessment process) are each treated separately below.

Spacecraft Information and Orbital Data Needed for Conjunction
Assessments
Because conjunction assessment identifies (and if necessary, mitigates) close approaches
between spacecraft, it requires access to a comprehensive space catalog of orbital information.
The USSPACECOM space catalog is the base catalog used by nearly all conjunction assessment
practitioners. Earlier sections of this document described the pre-launch registration and
coordination process with USSPACECOM to receive basic launch and on-orbit conjunction
assessment services. Several commercial conjunction assessment service providers offer
conjunction assessment products derived from alternative space catalogs. O/Os are encouraged to
pursue commercial services, particularly when such services offer improvements and innovations
above and beyond what is available from USSPACECOM. However, NASA recommends O/Os
use the service offered by USSPACECOM as both a baseline and a supplement to commercially
procured services. This is because the objects contained in the commercial catalog may not be
the same as those in the DOD catalog and because the commercial vendor may provide
conjunction assessment services based on publicly available TLEs8 along with solutions for the
objects in their own catalog. These TLE-based solutions are not sufficiently accurate to be used

See Appendix E for more information about the use of TLEs.

6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

Best Practices Handbook
for conjunction assessment. (See Appendix L for information about how NASA validates and
uses commercial data.)
The USSPACECOM space catalog used for conjunction assessment contains position and
uncertainty information for the primary object.
‚Ä¢

If the primary object is not maneuverable, it is in principle possible to perform
conjunction assessment on its behalf entirely from catalog-based information. However,
satellite O/Os generally have a better understanding of the spacecraft‚Äôs construction and
thus its non-conservative force parameters such as the ballistic coefficient and solar
radiation pressure coefficient. So, the O/Os‚Äô prediction of the satellite‚Äôs future position,
captured in a predictive ephemeris, is often more reliable or at the least an important
adjoining datum to the future position information calculated from a space catalog entry.

‚Ä¢

For satellites that do maneuver, future position calculations from catalog information
alone will not capture any planned trajectory changes and thus will leave undiscovered
any satellite conjunctions that could arise from the modified trajectory.

Therefore, for both non-maneuverable and maneuverable spacecraft, but especially for the latter,
it is necessary that O/Os furnish predicted satellite state and uncertainty information, usually in
the form of an ephemeris that includes state covariance at each ephemeris point. The details of
the generation of such ephemerides that result in the most useful product for conjunction
assessment are described in the details portion that concludes this section.
While it is most important to submit such ephemerides to the screening entity, it is also helpful to
place them on a public-facing website for any space operator to download and process. Mutual
sharing of expected future positions is the best way for active satellites to avoid collisions with
each other. Claims that predicted ephemerides contain proprietary information of any
consequence are simply not compelling and, in any case, are outweighed by the safety benefit of
exchanging such information. Such ephemerides should be recomputed and reissued/reposted as
soon as a change to a spacecraft‚Äôs intended trajectory is planned.
In determining how to react when a primary satellite is found to be in conjunction with a
secondary, the logic path is governed heavily by whether the secondary object is an active,
maneuverable spacecraft.
‚Ä¢

If the object is non-maneuverable, then the object will follow a Keplerian orbit without
unexpected perturbations. Future positions can be predicted in a straightforward way
using a dynamical model.

‚Ä¢

If the object is an active spacecraft that either has shown a history of maneuvering or is
believed to be maneuverable, then it is quite possible that trajectory-changing maneuvers
are planned and the assumption of a Keplerian orbit is not appropriate.

For this reason, it is important to know whether any given spacecraft is active, capable of
maneuvering, and presently in a phase of satellite life in which maneuvering is possible. This
status can be documented and communicated by the O/Os‚Äô setting of the spacecraft‚Äôs active/dead
and maneuverable/non-maneuverable flags in its space-track.org record. This allows other O/Os
6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

31

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
to determine whether the satellite can or will change its trajectory in a non-Keplerian manner and
thus consider this possibility in conjunction assessment.
O/Os of active, maneuverable spacecraft should provide USSPACECOM with information
outlining basic information about each planned maneuver. This data should be uploaded to
www.space-track.org for the most efficient use. While in principle such information could be
reconstructed from submitted ephemerides, it is simpler and more accurate to provide the
information directly in this form. Providing maneuver notifications assists USSPACECOM in
updating their own catalog as they know when to look for maneuver activity and, if discovered
(and subsequently tracked), can expeditiously update the satellite‚Äôs catalog entry to reflect the
new trajectory. Of course, forwarding maneuver notifications is not a substitute for sending
updated ephemerides that contain the intended maneuvers. Rather, it is an accompanying
notification that allows better use of the received ephemerides and facilitates the
USSPACECOM mission.
More O/Os are considering or are including autonomous flight control features, especially in
large constellations in which the constellation management functions are complex. Autonomous
flight control features may include orbit maintenance maneuvers and, in some cases, even
conjunction risk mitigation maneuvers that are developed, scheduled, and executed from the
onboard control system without any active ground-based participation. While such approaches
can offer improved efficiencies, they present their own challenges.
Even if satellite maneuvers are planned and executed autonomously, these planned maneuvers
must be included in ephemerides and made available in near real time both to the screening
provider and more broadly. This is because, recognizing the latencies of the download and
distribution mechanisms, satellite maneuvers must not be executed without sufficient advance
notice to allow the conjunction assessment process to become aware of the intended maneuver
and ensure its safety. The amount of advance notice required is governed by the latencies in the
selected conjunction assessment process, which includes the O/O infrastructure to receive and
react to conjunction assessment information from the screening provider. The principal difficulty
is notifying other active, maneuverable satellites that may be contemplating their own
maneuvers. Maneuver intentions must be shared with other such O/Os in a satellite‚Äôs vicinity to
ensure that intended maneuvers by either or both operators, if executed, do not place both
satellites on a collision course.

6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

32

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Actively maintain the space-track.org record for the satellite, updating the
active/dead and maneuverable/non-maneuverable flags to reflect the satellite‚Äôs
current status.
B. Furnish predicted ephemerides that include state covariances to USSPACECOM
(and any additional commercial screening provider) and set the privileges to allow
any interested party to access and download this information.
C. Furnished ephemerides should possess the following characteristics:
a. Be of a 7-day predictive duration for LEO and 14 days for other orbits;
b. Be issued at least at the following frequencies:
i. Three times daily for spacecraft with perigee heights less than 500 km;
ii. Daily for other LEO orbits; and
iii. Twice weekly for other orbits.
c. Include all known maneuvers within the ephemerides‚Äô prediction duration.
d. Provide ephemeris point spacing of approximately 1/100th of an orbit, in either
time or true anomaly. (Certain scientific missions with extremely long orbits or
high eccentricities may require more specialized approaches.)
e. Contain a realistic covariance at each ephemeris point for at least the six
estimated state parameters. (Appendix I provides a practical guide for assessing
covariance realism, as well as some general principles for tuning the covariance
production process.)
f. Be formatted and distributed in the Consultative Committee for Space Data
Systems (CCSDS) standard Orbital Ephemeris Message (OEM) format,
preferably in the J2000 reference frame.
D. Furnish maneuver reports to USSPACECOM for any trajectory-altering satellite
maneuvers sufficiently in advance of maneuver execution to enable an O/O
evaluation of the maneuver‚Äôs safety. Employ the standard maneuver reporting
message for this notification.
E. When a maneuver becomes part of a satellite‚Äôs trajectory plan, generate and
submit to the screening provider an updated ephemeris that contains this new
maneuver as early as is feasible but certainly with sufficient advance notice to
enable an O/O evaluation of the maneuver‚Äôs safety.

Conjunction Assessment Screenings
The first step in the conjunction assessment process is to find close approaches between
protected (primary) objects and other objects, with the latter object set‚Äôs positions represented
either by ephemerides (if they are active spacecraft) or space catalog entries. Finding these close
approaches is accomplished by conjunction assessment screenings in which the predicted
positions of the primary object and all other space objects that survive a pre-filtering process are
compared.

6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

33

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
At USSPACECOM, conjunction assessment screenings are executed using a volumetric-based
approach: a physical screening volume (usually an ellipsoid) is ‚Äúflown‚Äù along the primary
object‚Äôs trajectory, and any secondary trajectories that penetrate this volume are considered
conjuncting objects. This screening is accomplished using a tool called the Astrodynamics
Support Workstation (ASW).
Volumetric screenings generate more close approaches than probabilistic or ‚Äúcovariance-based‚Äù
methods but are preferable because they essentially give a snapshot of the satellite catalog in the
vicinity of the primary‚Äôs ephemeris. If the screening volume is large enough, the conjunction
information can be used to determine the safety of not just the nominal trajectory but also any
reasonably sized maneuvers that the primary may choose to make.
Once these close approach objects are identified, further processing is invoked to determine the
precise time of closest approach between the two objects and the two objects‚Äô states and
covariances at that time.
A protected asset should be screened for close approaches against a comprehensive satellite
catalog at least daily with the results of this process obtained and processed by the O/O, also at
least daily. For active, maneuverable satellites that submit ephemerides to the screening process
as a way of including their planned maneuvers into their predicted trajectories, these
ephemerides should be screened against each other (subject to appropriate pre-filtering) in near
real time whenever an O/O submits an updated ephemeris. These ‚ÄúO/O vs O/O‚Äù screenings are
the best way to ensure that maneuver plans are communicated among O/Os to prevent
simultaneous maneuvers from causing a collision.
Current USSPACECOM practice is to conduct three screenings per day. Each screening predicts
close approaches between:
1. The ASW solution for each protected (active) asset against the full catalog;
2. O/O ephemerides submitted after the last screening against the full catalog; and
3. O/O ephemerides submitted after the last screening against all other unexpired
O/O-submitted ephemerides.
In other words, O/O-submitted ephemerides are screened against the full catalog when initially
submitted, then retained and screened against other O/O ephemerides until they expire.
Three screenings per day is a minimum frequency for higher-drag orbit regimes such as LEO
orbits with perigee heights below 500 km; daily screenings for other orbit regimes yields
sufficient accuracy.
(See the USSPACECOM Spaceflight Safety Handbook for details about the cadence and conduct
of conjunction assessment screenings.)

6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

34

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Submit predicted ephemerides for the spacecraft to a screening provider to be
screened for conjunctions at least daily with spacecraft in higher-drag orbit
regimes screened at least three times per day.
B. Ensure that an O/O ephemeris for an active, maneuverable spacecraft is screened
against other ephemerides from active, maneuverable spacecraft in near real time
after any such ephemeris is submitted to the screening provider.
C. Obtain and process these screening results from the screening provider at the
same frequency at which they are produced for both the full-catalog and O/O vs
O/O screening cases described above.

Conjunction Risk Assessment
Satellite conjunctions are approaches between two satellites closer than a specified set of
distances, which is often chosen to be much larger than the set that would pose an actual
collision threat. A key next step, therefore, is to evaluate each conjunction to determine if it
poses, or is likely to pose, a substantial risk of collision. This evaluation activity, called
conjunction risk assessment, comprises both the key calculations that feed the concept of risk
(that is, both collision likelihood and collision consequence) and the evaluations of the input data
that subtend these calculations to ensure that they constitute a basis for decision making. Only
conjunctions that are determined to be high risk merit the consideration of mitigation actions.
Methods proposed in the scientific literature for calculating and assessing satellite collision
likelihood have different merits and different risk tolerance orientations. Of all the possibilities,
Pc is the oldest, most straightforward, and most widely embraced collision likelihood parameter.
Because it is a present industry standard, NASA recommends that operators employ Pc as the
foundational element of their collision likelihood assessment. (See Appendix M for an extended
treatment of the recommendation for the use of Pc as the collision likelihood parameter.)
Two approaches to calculating the Pc are:
1. The ‚Äútwo-dimensional‚Äù Pc (2D-Pc) calculation approach, which was originally
introduced by Foster and Estes in 1992 with theoretical clarifications by Alfano (2005b)
and Chan (2008). This method is a durable simplification of the calculation that is valid
in most instances, but there are situations in which it does not perform accurately.
2. The ‚Äúthree-dimensional‚Äù Pc (3D-Pc) calculation method, which was originally
formulated by Coppola (2012) and ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù and extended by CARA. Once it has
completed final NASA validation, it is expected to be the recommended analytic
approach. This method is accurate for nearly every situation, tests exist to identify those
very few cases in which it may not be fully adequate, and it is computationally efficient.
Additionally, the primary and secondary object covariances for some orbit regimes can contain
significant correlated error, thus introducing inaccuracy in the calculated Pc. (See Appendix N
for a more detailed discussion of Pc calculation methods and related issues.)

the traditional two-dimensional and (when validated) the presently recommended threedimensional technique and to remove correlated error between the primary and secondary
covariances can be obtained free of charge at the public-facing CARA software repository. (See
Section 7 in this document for the specific URL.)
The value of the Pc threshold at which an O/O would choose to mitigate a conjunction is a
function of both the O/O‚Äôs risk tolerance and the volume of conjunctions that the O/O is able to
mitigate. In the conjunction assessment mission area, however, there has been broad
convergence on a per-event Pc mitigation threshold value of 1E-04, meaning that remediation
actions are recommended when the likelihood of collision is greater than 1 in 10,000. Missions
that wish a more conservative risk posture can select a more demanding Pc threshold such as
1E-05. This infused conservatism may allow more streamlined risk assessment techniques in
other areas.
Finally, some practitioners like to include an additional imperative to mitigate when the
predicted miss distance is smaller than the hard-body radius or a distance close to the hard-body
radius value. This predicted miss distance approach would need to be invoked only rarely
because a small miss distance typically produces a Pc that violates most commonly accepted Pc
mitigation thresholds. (See Appendix N for more information about the hard-body radius
calculation.)
Other risk assessment methods exist (e.g., Alfano 2005b, Carpenter and Markey 2014, Balch et
al. 2019) and are generally considered to be more conservative than the Pc-based methodology
advocated above. O/Os are encouraged to employ a more conservative conjunction assessment
approach if it suits their risk posture. However, the Pc method and the mitigation threshold of
1E-04 enjoy wide acceptance in the conjunction assessment industry and historically have
provided a sustainable balance between safety and mission impact.
Risk is the product of the likelihood of an unfavorable event and the consequence of that event,
should it occur. For some time, it has been presumed that any satellite collision is a catastrophic
event that is to be avoided by any means possible. In most cases, such events will render an
active satellite unusable, presenting a very serious risk to the O/O. Therefore, the likelihood (Pc)
was computed, and the consequence was not factored into the computation.
However, as the orbit environment grows, there may come a point when an O/O is faced with too
many conjunctions to avoid individually. In this case, one method to triage the conjunctions to
determine which should be mitigated to best protect both the spacecraft and the orbital
environment is computation and application of the consequence as part of the risk determination.
Satellite collisions, depending on satellite masses and relative velocity, can produce wildly
different amounts of orbital debris from a handful of pieces to many thousands of pieces large
enough to critically damage a spacecraft. To be sure, introducing any debris at all into the space
environment is to be avoided. Conjunctions that, if they were to result in a collision, would
produce only a small amount of debris (maybe fewer than 50 pieces) could be addressed using a
more lenient mitigation threshold to prioritize them appropriately against those that would create
more debris. A threshold that is an order of magnitude more lenient than what is used for high6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

36

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
debris conjunctions would align in magnitude with other situations in which relaxing the
mitigation threshold is warranted (Hejduk et al. 2017). (See Appendix O for a more expansive
treatment of the assessment of a conjunction‚Äôs debris production potential. See the CARA
software repository for software to calculate debris production potential; see Section 7 in this
document for the specific URL.)
Finally, the data used to calculate the parameters that feed the risk assessment decision, namely
the state estimates and accompanying uncertainty volumes (covariances) for the primary and
secondary objects, must be examined to determine whether they manifest problematic elements
that would prevent the calculated parameters from serving as a basis for conjunction mitigation
actions. In such cases, it is possible that executing a mitigation action based on those data could
make the conjunction situation worse rather than better.
A non-actionability situation with USSPACECOM conjunction assessment products occurs
occasionally. For example, an object whose state has been propagated longer than the orbit
determination fit-span in order to reach TCA is considered under most conditions to be
insufficiently tracked and over-propagated and thus not suitable as a basis for conjunction
mitigation actions. (See Appendix P for a recommended procedure to evaluate USSPACECOM
conjunction assessment products for actionability.) Occasionally one of the two objects in a
conjunction lacks a covariance, making probabilistic conjunction assessment impossible but still
enabling other risk assessment methods. (See Appendix P for a discussion of such situations.)

6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

37

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. Use the Probability of Collision (Pc) as the principal collision likelihood
assessment metric.
B. Pursue mitigation if the Pc value exceeds 1E-04 (1 in 10,000).
C. Pursue mitigation if the estimated total miss distance is less than the hard-body
radius value.
D. Employ the current operational NASA Pc calculation methodology for routine Pc
calculation. Consider removing correlated error from the primary and secondary
object joint covariance.
E. As a prioritization method for situations in which the number of conjunctions
meeting mitigation criteria exceeds the ability of the O/O to mitigate, estimate the
amount of debris that a conjunction would produce if it were to result in a
collision. A less stringent Pc an order of magnitude lower could be appropriate in
such cases.
F. If employing USSPACECOM data products for conjunction assessment, use the
procedure given in Appendix P to determine whether the data for a particular
conjunction are actionable and thus constitute a basis for conjunction assessmentrelated decisions.
G. If a different conjunction assessment product provider is chosen, develop and
employ data actionability criteria for this provider‚Äôs conjunction assessment
information to determine conjunction assessment event actionability.

Conjunction Risk Mitigation
O/Os with satellites that possess the ability to mitigate conjunctions have a responsibility to
perform mitigation actions when required. In practical terms, this means that a mitigation action
should be tendered when a conjunction‚Äôs risk parameter, usually the Pc, exceeds the mitigation
threshold at the ‚Äúmaneuver commitment point,‚Äù which is that point in time before the TCA when
a decision to mitigate is needed in order for the mitigation action to be in place before the TCA
actually occurs. The most typical (and effective) mitigation action is changing the satellite‚Äôs
trajectory to avoid a possible collision with the secondary either by thrusting to effect a satellite
maneuver or, in some cases, changing the satellite‚Äôs attitude to alter its drag coefficient and thus
its trajectory. An additional, although generally much less effective approach is to change the
satellite‚Äôs attitude simply to reduce the satellite‚Äôs cross-sectional area in the direction of the
oncoming secondary. This does not fully mitigate the close approach but reduces the likelihood
of an actual collision between the two objects.
When planning a mitigation action, the general practice is to choose a trajectory alteration that
reduces the Pc for the conjunction by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. A recent study (Hall 2019a)
showed that a Pc reduction by 1.5 orders of magnitude (that is, by a factor of ~0.03) marked the
beginning of diminishing return with regard to lifetime satellite collision risk. Therefore, NASA
recommends a minimum of 1.5 orders of magnitude reduction in Pc as a post-mitigation Pc goal;
6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

38

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
i.e., if the recommended mitigation threshold of 1E-04 is used, the post-mitigation goal would be
~3.2E-06 or lower.
In general, there is a trade-off between mitigation maneuver size and maneuver execution time.
To mitigate a conjunction adequately, smaller maneuvers can be used if the maneuver is made
earlier; that is, farther in advance of TCA. Waiting until closer to TCA will typically require a
larger maneuver to achieve the same Pc reduction. However, because most conjunction events
drop off to a low level of risk before TCA (due to additional tracking and improved state
estimates and covariances), waiting until closer to TCA to perform a mitigation action increases
the likelihood that it can be determined not to be necessary. Thus, O/Os must decide in each case
whether they wish to act earlier with a less invasive action required or whether they wish to wait
until closer to TCA in the hopes of observing the collision likelihood drop below the mitigation
threshold and thus being able to waive off the maneuver, but knowing that, if an action is still
required, it will be larger and more disruptive. There is no clear rubric for how to proceed in such
cases, but external considerations, such as staffing availability for a later maneuver and amount
of disruption that a large maneuver would require, often govern the decision.
When performing a trajectory-changing mitigation action, ‚Äúnew‚Äù conjunctions and/or elevated
Pc values of existing conjunctions often occur. O/Os should ensure any mitigation action does
not render the overall safety-of-flight evaluation worse by producing a more dangerous situation
than would have existed without the mitigation action. One could examine the amalgamated risk
of all the conjunctions in the near future and conduct mitigation planning on this basis, but it is
generally acceptable to pursue mitigation of the one conjunction that violates the threshold (and
remediate it to a Pc 1.5 orders of magnitude below the threshold) while ensuring that no new
conjunctions are produced that exceed the threshold. Using the thresholds recommended here,
this means bringing the violating conjunction down to a Pc of 3.2E-06 without introducing or
raising any other conjunction Pc values above 1E-04. The best way to ensure that these standards
are met is to generate an ephemeris that includes the mitigation action and submit it to the
screening provider for a special screening action. This will produce a fresh set of CDMs against
the planned mitigation action and allow easy and reliable verification that the Pc values for both
the principal conjunction and any ancillary conjunctions remain below the desired levels.
Using larger screening volumes and analyzing the maneuver against the resulting CDMs is
another method of determining whether the maneuver creates close approaches. This method
creates CDMs for conjunctions that are somewhat far away from the nominal trajectory but
might constitute worrisome conjunctions after a maneuver. This method for ensuring the safety
of the post-maneuver trajectory is serviceable for debris objects, which will not alter their orbits
beyond Keplerian models. However, this method does not protect against potential, yet-to-bedisclosed trajectory changes by other maneuverable satellites.
Choosing a mitigation action for a conjunction against a non-maneuverable secondary is
generally straightforward, but the situation is much more complicated when the secondary object
is an active, maneuverable spacecraft. While submitted ephemerides from that secondary‚Äôs O/O
is a statement of that spacecraft‚Äôs intended trajectory at the time of production, it is likely that the
secondary‚Äôs O/O has also noticed the conjunction and may be planning a mitigation action of its
own. In addition to the fact that two mitigation actions for the same close approach are
6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

39

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
unnecessary, there is a real danger that the two mitigation actions could place the two satellites
on even more of a collision course than taking no action at all.
Establishing contact with the O/O of an active secondary is critical to jointly establishing a way
forward for the particular conjunction. The O/Os should jointly decide which satellite will pursue
mitigation (should it remain necessary at the maneuver commitment point) and what the
mitigation action will be and constrain the trajectory of the non-mitigating satellite to that given
in its published ephemeris until after the TCA has passed.
Given the recent industry trend to extremely large satellite constellations, the individual reaching
out to other O/Os is unlikely to scale adequately as such constellations continue to grow. A more
automated mechanism for exchanging maneuver intentions among O/Os will likely be necessary.
SPD-3 directs the movement of conjunction assessment activities away from DOD to a Federal
civil agency by 2024, so it makes sense for this new entity to develop an architecture and
protocol for the exchange of this type of information. For the present, O/Os need to share their
maneuver intentions with other O/Os through direct contact or a third-party organization, such as
the Space Data Association9 with some amount of manual interaction required.

6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

40

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. When a conjunction‚Äôs Pc at the mitigation action commitment point exceeds the
mitigation threshold (recommended to be 1E-04), pursue a mitigation action that
will reduce the Pc by at least 1.5 orders of magnitude from the remediation
threshold.
B. Ensure that an ephemeris containing the mitigation action is screened against the
full catalog, not a large screening volume collection of CDMs.
C. Ensure that the mitigation action does not create any additional conjunctions with
a Pc value above the mitigation threshold (for which the recommended value is
1E-04).
D. When the secondary object is an active, maneuverable spacecraft, reach out to the
secondary‚Äôs O/O and jointly establish a way forward for the particular
conjunction, including deciding which spacecraft will maneuver and freezing the
other spacecraft‚Äôs planned trajectory until the TCA has passed.
E. Use space-track.org contact information to engage other O/Os.

Automated Trajectory Guidance and Maneuvering
Satellite designers are increasingly taking advantage of the automation of maneuver planning and
execution to simplify mission operations. Particularly with large constellations of satellites,
automation can substantially increase efficiency over traditional flight control techniques.
However, the automation processes in which flight dynamics computations and decision making
occur largely or even entirely without human intervention, and especially when they are executed
on board the satellites themselves, can present real concerns related to space traffic management
and the prevention of collisions between satellites.
With traditional ground-computed and executed trajectory adjustments that have humans in the
loop, satellite operators can compute maneuvers, produce predicted ephemeris data to transmit to
the rest of the community to be screened for conjunctions, and command the execution of safe
maneuvers to effect that advertised trajectory. Admittedly, such a technique does not scale easily
for large constellations, but it has proven reliable and serviceable for securing safety of flight
over years of experience.
However, highly automated systems can now be designed in which satellites, using onboard
navigation and a programmed target, can compute their own maneuvers and execute them
without notification to, or pre-coordination with, their ground control; in such a case, explicit
screening of the maneuver by USSPACECOM or some other screening authority, as well as
notification to the rest of the space community, would frequently not be possible. If other space
operators are not aware that a satellite is planning a maneuver, the other operators may also plan
a maneuver and the two maneuvers taken together may cause a collision.
Operators of automated satellite systems should ensure that, when contemplating a maneuver, the
intended time, direction, and magnitude of that maneuver (as well as other event-related data for
conjunction risk maneuvers) be communicated to the screening authority at a sufficient interval
6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

41

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
of time before the maneuver so that the maneuver ephemeris can be screened before execution.
This communication is most important in ensuring safety of flight between active maneuverable
spacecraft, each of which may be generating maneuver plans that, if executed as intended, will
create a collision. Maneuver plans should be shared with the screening authority as a predicted
ephemeris and, if possible, a maneuver notification report; and it is highly desirable that this
information be shared without restriction, perhaps by posting predicted ephemerides so that any
interested party can download them, without restriction.
One method that some operators use to facilitate maneuver planning is to request from the
screening authority the use of a screening volume size that encompasses a large amount of
orbital space, ensuring that they receive a large set of CDMs that is representative of all the
spacecraft operating nearby. The operators then use these CDMs to internally plan maneuvers
and screen them against this set of CDMs to ensure that the planned maneuver does not cause a
close approach with any of the objects for which they have CDM data. While largely effective
against non-maneuvering objects, this practice cannot fully account for the fact that the other
objects may themselves be maneuverable spacecraft also altering their trajectories. So, if both
maneuverable spacecraft do not send their predicted trajectories back to the screening authority
for reconciliation, they will not be aware of each other‚Äôs plan and may in fact cause a collision.
At some point in the future, an automated clearinghouse may be in place for such information to
allow near real time receipt and circulation of ephemerides containing maneuver plans to other
O/Os. There is work underway at NASA in partnership with industry to design and prototype a
ground node that includes near-real-time screening of submitted ephemerides, as well as
mechanisms for the two spacecraft to assign responsibility for mitigating a specific conjunction.
Hopefully, this capability will be available as part of the Office of Space Commerce‚Äôs future
space traffic coordination system. Quick and efficient screening of planned maneuvers generated
by onboard systems requires the creation and operation of this central, low-latency ephemeris
‚Äúclearinghouse.‚Äù So, to achieve this future vision of safe operations, both industrial and
governmental action is necessary.
At present, however, the USSPACECOM screening process is performed only once every 8
hours. It is possible that a file received from an operator may just miss a screening opportunity,
and therefore it may take up to16 hours to screen the predicted trajectory. Therefore, spacecraft
using this information to plan onboard maneuvers are obligated to allow this much time in
advance for screening their maneuver prior to executing to ensure safety of other on-orbit
neighbors. This timeline also affects non-autonomous spacecraft, as they want to ensure that
their planned trajectory is taken into account by the autonomous spacecraft, so they also must
include the 16 hour advance notice, although that timeline is more typical for traditional groundbased flight dynamics processes.
Once a maneuver is autonomously planned and submitted for screening, the maneuver should be
executed as designed unless an alteration is required for safety of flight. Remaining with the
communicated plan, even if more efficient possibilities arise in the interval leading up to
maneuver execution, enables the rest of the space community to use the submitted ephemeris as
the basis for their own trajectory planning.
6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

42

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
There may be situations in which a satellite should not execute an intended maneuver that the
automation computes, such as in the presence of a surprise post-maneuver conjunction or a
conjunction with an active satellite involving cooperative, human-in-the-loop conjunction event
management. It is thus imperative for safety reasons that automated systems include the ability to
pause or abort any maneuver planned for execution in response to ground command.
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended for use by operators
of constellations with automated flight dynamics systems:
A. When an onboard flight dynamics system computes any maneuver to alter the
satellite‚Äôs orbit for mission or conjunction mitigation purposes, communicate
maneuver details to the operating ground control early enough to enable a
USSPACECOM screening and appropriate action in response to the screening
results.
B. Share maneuver plans with USSPACECOM both as a predicted ephemeris with
realistic covariance and, when possible, as a maneuver report. Allow these
notifications to be publicly viewed and downloaded by any interested party.
C. Execute a maneuver as intended once a maneuver is autonomously planned and
externally communicated unless an alteration is required for safety of flight.
D. Include the ability to pause or abort, for safety reasons, any maneuver planned by
the automated system, regardless of whether the maneuver is planned by a ground
system or on board the satellite.
E. Ensure an automated maneuvering system can temporarily suspend automatic
conjunction assessment activities to allow another operator to maneuver.
F. Rapidly submit a new ephemeris for screening if a maneuver is not executed as
planned in the original file sent for screening, such as if a maneuver fails.
G. Keep spacecraft maneuverability status on space-track.org up-to-date so other
O/Os know whether any particular satellite is capable of maneuvering.
H. If onboard flight dynamics planning is used, be able to communicate back to
operational secondary satellite O/Os that the relevant information to enable a
maneuver to mitigate a conjunction between them is on board the satellite and
will be acted upon.
I. Request a larger-than-average screening volume from your screening provider to
ensure that the ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù of the space catalog available to your satellites is
broadly inclusive and thus allows maneuver planning to take cognizance of all
possible hazards in choosing a new trajectory. This maximizes the chances that,
when screened before execution, the chosen maneuver will be safe.

Other Considerations
The items in this section are best practices that affect orbit design and so, while not directly
related to the conjunction assessment process, are appropriate to consider.
6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

43

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Light Pollution. After the launch of the initial portion of the SpaceX Starlink constellation,
astronomers noticed that their observing campaigns were being affected by extremely bright,
detector-saturating streaks due to the Starlink vehicles. To minimize interference with Earthbased astronomy, O/Os should ensure that spacecraft are built and flown in such a way as to
minimize the creation of light pollution.
Adverse astronomical effects arise from satellites reflecting sunlight (e.g., in the visible and nearinfrared (IR) spectral bands) and emitting radiation (e.g., in the thermal-IR and radio bands), as
well as from occultations in which satellites block the light from astronomical objects. Groundbased sensors in the visible and near-IR bands are most challenged by constellations with
satellites that are brighter than about 7th stellar magnitude and that glint brightly in reflected
sunlight, especially if deployed at inclinations close to the observatory latitude, and,
counterintuitively, at higher orbital altitudes (Walker et al. 2020; Bassa et al. 2022). Comparable
orbit inclinations and observatory latitudes result in significantly more frequent crossings of the
telescope‚Äôs field of view. Higher altitudes result in a lower relative velocity between satellite and
telescope, which increases dwell-time on each sensor pixel, causing saturation that irreparably
contaminates data. Lower altitude satellites also tend to enter Earth‚Äôs shadow earlier during
astronomical nighttime periods, decreasing the duration of their adverse effects, even though
they still can cause light pollution during twilight periods.
To preserve the appearance of the night sky and limit adverse effects on ground-based
observations, the consensus recommendation of the astronomical community is to keep satellites
fainter than the recommended V-band magnitude limit of ùëÄùëâ = 7 + 2.5 log10 (‚Ñé/550km), with
h indicating the altitude (Walker et al. 2020). This corresponds to ùëÄùëâ = 7 for the population of
Starlink constellation satellites currently deployed at 550 km altitude, and ùëÄùëâ = 7.85 for the
OneWeb satellites at 1,200 km. Factors that affect the brightness of individual satellites include
size, albedo, surface characteristics, degree of specular vs diffuse reflection, self-shadowing, and
orientation, as well as observation and illumination ranges and angles. Both a constellation‚Äôs
overall population and individual satellite brightnesses are important considerations because
ground-based observations will be affected significantly by the existence of large numbers of
bright satellites during astronomical nighttime observing conditions. Hall (2022) describes a
method of evaluating light pollution levels for proposed or nascent constellations that
incorporates a constellation‚Äôs population, orbital distribution, and empirical or modeled
brightness distribution to estimate the number of brighter-than-recommended satellites
statistically expected to exist above observatories distributed over the Earth and throughout a
year. Notably, using this method, if all of a constellation‚Äôs satellites are consistently fainter than
the recommended ùëÄùëâ limit given above, then even a large constellation could be evaluated to
have acceptable visible and near-IR band light pollution levels. (This evaluation method is
included in the EvaluateConstellation function of the Software Development Kit (SDK) in the
NASA CARA software repository. See Section 7, Contact Information in this document for the
specific URL.)
For constellations duplicating the same (or similar) manufacturing design for a large satellite
population, O/Os should not rely on rough analyses or first-order assumptions about expected
brightnesses. Instead, a full satellite brightness model that includes Bidirectional Reflectance
6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

44

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Distribution Function (BRDF) characterization of surface materials should be undertaken during
the design phase to estimate the brightness distributions of the deployed constellation. O/Os
should consider all mission phases including launch, ascent, and descent (Seitzer 2020). The
SATCON-1 Workshop10 Report (Walker et al. 2020) provides the following four specific
recommendations for constellation O/Os to encourage careful up-front design to minimize
brightness and avoid glints to the greatest extent possible:
‚Ä¢

LEO constellation operators should perform adequate laboratory BRDF measurements as
part of their satellite design and development phase. This would be particularly effective
when paired with a reflectance simulation analysis.

‚Ä¢

Reflected sunlight ideally should vary slowly with orbital phase as recorded by high
etendue (effective area ÔÇ¥ field of view), large-aperture ground-based telescopes to be
fainter than 7 + 2.5 log10 (‚Ñé/550km), equivalent to 44 ÔÇ¥ (550km/‚Ñé) W/steradian.

‚Ä¢

Operators should make their best effort to avoid specular reflection (flares) in the
direction of observatories. If such flares do occur, accurate timing information from
ground-based observing will be required for avoidance.

‚Ä¢

Pointing avoidance by observatories is achieved most readily if the immediate postlaunch satellite configuration is clumped as tightly as possible consistent with safety,
affording rapid passage of the train through a given pointing area. In addition, satellite
attitudes should be adjusted to minimize reflected light on the ground track.

If possible, brightness distributions should also be measured using ground-based photometric
observations of actual satellites (if already orbiting for partially deployed constellations) or
scaled from observations of orbiting prototype/analog satellites based on a similar manufacturing
design (if available). Hall (2022) describes how such empirical, ground-based brightness
distributions can be used to estimate astronomical light pollution levels, even for constellations
deployed in multiple altitude shells and with different inclinations. The SATCON-2 Workshop
Report (Walker et al. 2021) describes the on-going effort to establish the ‚ÄúSathub‚Äù repository of
photometric observations of constellation satellites, as well as several software tools to aid both
astronomers and constellation O/Os in the effort to mitigate astronomical light pollution.

The National Science Foundation‚Äôs (NSF‚Äôs) National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory
(NOIRLab) and the American Astronomical Society, with support from NSF, hosted the Satellite Constellations 1
(SATCON1) workshop virtually from 29 June to 2 July 2020.

6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
To address this topic, the following specific practices are recommended:
A. As part of spacecraft physical design and orbit selection, perform a spacecraft
photometric brightness analysis to determine whether the spacecraft is likely to
present an impediment to ground-based astronomy. Consider changes to the
satellite‚Äôs construction, materials, or operating attitudes to reduce expected
photometric brightness to levels that will not impede ground-based astronomy.
B. If a large constellation is being planned, either use a full BRDF-based
photometric model or ground-based observations of actual orbiting satellites, if
available, to obtain a durable estimate of the entire constellation‚Äôs expected
brightness distribution as deployed on orbit.
C. If the constellation, given its population, orbit, and constituent satellites, is likely
to affect ground-based astronomy, reassign the satellite orbits or modify the
satellite construction to eliminate this effect.

Cislunar Space. Cislunar space is the three-dimensional volume of space beyond Earth‚Äôs
geosynchronous orbit that is mainly under the gravitational influence of the Earth and/or the
Moon. Cislunar space includes the Earth-Moon Lagrange point regions (defined below),
trajectories utilizing those regions, and the Lunar surface. (Taken from the ‚ÄúNational Cislunar
Science & Technology Strategy‚Äù from the National Science & Technology Council‚Äôs Cislunar
technology strategy Interagency Working Group.)
COLA Gap. The period between when traditional LCOLA ends and an on-orbit asset can
mitigate a risk using standard on-orbit conjunction assessment methods (i.e., until the object can
be cataloged and is available for conjunction assessment screening).
Collision Avoidance. The planning and execution of risk mitigation strategies to avoid a
collision between two space objects. (See also conjunction mitigation.).
Colocation. Being in the vicinity of another operational spacecraft close enough that systematic
conjunctions occur.
Conjunction. A close approach between two objects that is predicted to occur because the
secondary object passes within a chosen geometric or statistical safety volume about the
protected asset (also called ‚Äúprimary object‚Äù).
Conjunction analysis. The process of predicting a close-approach event by screening the
ephemeris of the protected asset against the space object catalog (i.e., conjunction assessment)
and then analyzing the event to determine the associated threat to the asset (risk assessment).
Conjunction Assessment. The identification of close approaches using ephemeris screening
against a catalog of resident space objects.
Conjunction Mitigation. An action taken to remediate conjunction risk, including a propulsive
maneuver, an attitude adjustment (e.g., for differential drag or to minimize frontal area), or
providing ephemeris data to secondary owner/operators so that they can perform an avoidance
maneuver.
Conjunction Risk Assessment. The process of assessing a conjunction (predicted close
approach) to determine the likelihood of two space objects colliding and to determine the
expected consequence if they collide in terms of spacecraft inoperability and expected debris
production.
Covariance. Characterization of uncertainty components and their interactions surrounding a
space object‚Äôs estimated state at a given time.
Demise. When a spacecraft is no longer in space such as a complete burn up on reentry.
Spacecraft passivation and migration to disposal orbits occur prior to demise.
Disposal. An end-of-mission process involving a spacecraft‚Äôs passivation and reentry into the
atmosphere for its ultimate demise or its movement (if necessary) to an orbit or trajectory
considered acceptable for orbital debris limitation. For purposes of this NPR, ‚Äúdisposal‚Äù includes

the reorbiting or deorbiting of a spacecraft at the end of mission. Disposal occurs prior to
spacecraft demise.
Ephemeris (plural: ephemerides). A file containing a time-ordered set of position and velocity
measurements describing an object's predicted trajectory.
Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO). An orbit with period between 1300 and 1800 minutes,
eccentricity (e) <0.25, and inclination (i) <35 degrees. Note that this definition is chosen to align
with the definition used by USSPACECOM, which provides conjunction assessment screenings.
Hard-body radius. The radius of a circle equal to the sum of the circumscribing radii of both the
protected plus the secondary spacecraft.
High Earth Orbit (HEO). An orbit with period greater than 225 minutes and eccentricity
greater than 0.25. Note that this definition is chosen to align with the definition used by
USSPACECOM, which provides conjunction assessment screenings.

less than 0.25. Note that this definition is chosen to align with the definition used by
USSPACECOM, which provides conjunction assessment screenings.
Maneuver Plan. The specific parameters that represent a planned spacecraft maneuver,
including execution time, burn duration, and delta-v. The position and velocity of a single object
at a specified epoch is specified in an Orbit Parameter Message (OPM). The industry message
standard for communicating maneuver plans is the Consultative Committee for Space Data
Systems (CCSDS) standard CCSDS 502.0-B-2, ‚ÄúOrbit Data Messages,‚Äù Section 3 located at

avoid an orbital conjunction.
Maneuverable spacecraft. A spacecraft that has capability permitting the manipulation of the
spacecraft‚Äôs trajectory in a non-Keplerian fashion.
Non-cooperative tracking data. Data obtained describing the location of space objects that do
not themselves actively provide location data. For example, a piece of orbital debris that has no
transponder could not provide ephemeris data. Other examples include natural objects such as
asteroids, and spacecraft belonging to operators who do not choose to share an ephemeris for
their spacecraft.

space flight, i.e., non-human space flight. These space flight missions are supported by the
CARA Program.
Orbit Regime. The general location of an orbit in space, such as the perigee height and whether
the orbit is eccentric, used to assign it to a general orbit category.
Orbital debris. In this NPR, orbital debris is defined as any object placed in space by humans
that no longer serves any useful function. Objects range from spacecraft to spent launch vehicle

stages to components and include materials, fragments, trash, or other objects that are
intentionally or inadvertently cast off or generated. (Derived from NPR 8715.6.)
Payload. A specific complement of instruments, sensors, equipment, and support hardware
carried into space to accomplish a mission or a discrete activity in outer space. Personnel are not
considered a payload or a part of a payload.

potential collisions are being performed and collision avoidance mitigation activities are being
considered and possibly performed.
Resident space object. An artificial object that orbits Earth.
Safety volume. A volume defined around a protected asset as a zone for predicting close
approaches with a ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù space object entering that volume.
Secondary object. Any cataloged object residing in space that passes through the safety volume
of a protected (i.e., primary) asset when the protected asset with its safety volume is flown along
its trajectory. The resident space object is identified as a ‚Äúsecondary object‚Äù and is the
conjuncting object in a predicted future close-approach event. The secondary object may be an
operated spacecraft.
Secondary payload. A payload that is manifested subordinate to a primary or co-manifested
payload and is, therefore, subordinate in launch date and orbit selection. (See also ‚Äúpayload,‚Äù
‚Äúprimary payload,‚Äù and ‚Äúrideshare.‚Äù)
Space Flight Mission. NASA space flight programs, projects, and activities (including
spacecraft, launch vehicles, payloads, and instruments developed for space flight programs and
projects, some research and technology developments funded by and to be incorporated into
space flight programs and projects.
Space situational awareness. The knowledge and characterization of space objects and their
operational environment to support safe, stable, and sustainable space activities. (From Space

3.0 History
3.2 USSPACECOM Conjunction Assessment Process
3.2.A
Obtain a space-track.org account.
3.2.B
Become familiar with the Spaceflight Safety Handbook
contents.
3.2.C
Use USSPACECOM conjunction assessment service as a
minimum for screenings, even if additional commercial data or
services are used.
3.2.1.A Provide seven (7) days of predicted ephemeris (including
maneuvers) to USSPACECOM for screening for LEO
spacecraft, and provide 14 days for other Earth orbits; e.g., High
Earth Orbit (HEO)/Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO).
3.2.2.A Provide at least one ephemeris per day to be screened and three
ephemerides per day in the lower-drag LEO regime (perigee
height less than 500 km).
3.2.2.B Determine whether the O/O‚Äôs process for obtaining screening
results and performing conjunction risk assessment aligns with
the timeline of the USSPACECOM process. If the timelines do
not align in such a way as to enable timely and efficient
screening support, pursue a rearrangement of the O/O‚Äôs process
to minimize data latency and optimize screening efficiency.
3.2.3.A Populate and maintain the point-of-contact section on spacetrack.org with your operations contact data. Be sure that the
operations contact can be reached 24/7 due to time zone
differences between operators and the immediate nature of
certain conjunction assessment emergencies.
3.2.3.B Use standard ephemeris, CDM, and maneuver notification
formats defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data
Systems (CCSDS).
3.3 NASA Partnership with USSPACECOM
3.3.A
Develop a robust safety-of-flight process that includes both
conjunction assessment screening and risk assessment to inform
close approach mitigation decisions.
Appendix C. Best Practices List

Section
3.3.B

Best Practice
Large constellation operators should work with USSPACECOM
pre-launch to determine if variations from the standard approach
are necessary and, if so, to define a tailored screening process.
3.3.C
Large constellation operators should consider working with
NASA to define a risk assessment process. NASA is an
experienced representative operator. Including NASA in
discussions regarding establishing a conjunction assessment
process will ensure that the process will work with most
operators for risk assessment purposes.
3.4.2.A Owner/operators should conform to recommendations in the
NASA Technical Publication ‚ÄúAstrodynamics Convention and
Modeling Reference for Lunar, Cislunar, and Libration Point
Orbits.‚Äù
3.4.2.B Cislunar mission support entities (sensors, catalog maintainers,
etc.) should conform to the enhanced SSA message set (Butt
2021) when creating cislunar SSA architectures.
3.4.2.C Owner/operators should maintain accurate orbit determination
solutions and predicted covariance for objects in cislunar space.
3.4.2.D Owner/operators should deliver predicted ephemeris with
covariance in the CCSDS format to space-track.org and to the
DSN SPS portal.
4.0 Spacecraft and Constellation Design

Comment

4.1 Ascent to/Disposal from the Constellation‚Äôs Operational Orbit
4.1.A
Perform a study to compute the number of expected close
approaches anticipated during ascent and descent as well as the
imputed additional satellite reliability that will be required to
meet satellite disposal requirements at the chosen operational
orbit.
4.1.B
If the results of the study show a large burden, consider
choosing a different mission orbit with a lower burden.
4.1.C
All missions should review and follow the ODMSP guidance
standards.
4.1.D
When practicable, pursue active disposal using the fastest
disposal option available.
4.1.E
Recognize that transiting spacecraft should yield way to onstation spacecraft and thus take responsibility for any
conjunction risk mitigation maneuvers or transient trajectory
alterations that may be required.
4.1.F
When planning descent using thrusters, if not planning an
approach of circular-orbit altitude reduction, coordinate with the
NASA JSC TOPO to ensure that perigee-lowering approaches

Best Practice
do not present persistent and problematic orbital crossings with
the ISS and other human space flight assets.
4.2 General Orbit Selection: Debris Object Density
4.2.A
Include considerations of orbital debris density when selecting
candidate mission orbits. Debris density diagrams, indexed by
object size, are published by the NASA Orbital Debris Program
Office (ODPO). (See Appendix G for more information and
examples.)
4.2.B
When choosing from the final set of candidate orbits, perform a
conjunction frequency analysis to determine the number of
conjunction assessment high interest events per spacecraft per
year that can be expected in each of the proposed orbital areas.
4.3 Vehicle- and Constellation-Specific Orbit Selection: Spacecraft Colocation
4.3.A
During orbit selection, perform an orbit colocation analysis to
determine whether any of the proposed orbits is likely to create
systematic conjunctions with existing actively maintained
satellites.
4.3.B
If the orbit colocation analysis identifies systematic
conjunctions, consider modifying the proposed orbit(s) slightly
to eliminate this possibility. Optimizing orbit placement may be
appropriate.
4.3.C
If the selected orbit is likely to present systematic conjunctions
with a pre-existing spacecraft, then coordinate with the other
operator(s) to arrange a process to coordinate maneuver plans
routinely during the life of the mission.
4.4 Launch-Related Conjunction Assessment
4.4.A
Protect human space flight assets from close approaches during
the COLA gap using stand-off distance or statistical measures.
4.4.B
Conform to additional LCOLA requirements that the launch
range may impose.
4.5 Spacecraft Trackability
4.5.A
Through selection of physical design and materials, ensure that
the satellite is trackable by SSN from deployment until demise.
a. For spacecraft with perigee heights less than 2000 km, the
spacecraft should have characteristic dimensions of at least
10 cm in each major dimension.
b. For spacecraft with perigee heights greater than 2000 km,
the spacecraft should have characteristic dimensions of at
least 50 cm in each major dimension.

c. If the spacecraft cannot meet these dimension constraints,
use a proven detectability enhancement.
d. For spacecraft having orbits that span a large range of
altitudes, ensure that the spacecraft is trackable at all
altitudes.
4.6 Spacecraft Reliability
4.6.A
Ensure that spacecraft reliability is high enough that the
likelihood of each spacecraft remaining fully functional until it
can be disposed of meets or exceeds 99%.
4.6.B
Reassess the 99% analysis whenever the underlying
assumptions change; for example, extending operations beyond
design life or failures in key systems.
4.7 Development of Capabilities for Ephemeris Generation and Conjunction Risk Assessment
and Mitigation
4.7.A
Develop and implement a capability to generate and share
accurate predicted spacecraft ephemerides including any
planned maneuvers. (See Section 3.1 for a discussion of
ephemeris sharing for screening. See Section 6.2 for specific
guidance on ephemeris generation frequency, length, point
spacing, formatting, and contents.)
4.7.B
Determine during spacecraft design what risk mitigation
approaches are possible for the spacecraft. While trajectory
modification via thrusting maneuver is the most common
approach, other approaches such as differential drag orbit
modification are possible.
4.7.C
Develop and implement or arrange to acquire a capability to
process CDMs and to compute conjunction risk assessment
parameters such as the Pc.
4.7.D
Develop and implement or arrange to acquire a risk analysis
capability to select mitigation actions that will lower the Pc for
dangerous conjunctions to a user-selected value.
4.7.E
Validate conjunction assessment tools well before flight,
typically 6-12 months prior.
5.0 Pre-Launch Preparation and Early Launch Activities
5.1 CONOPS Discussions and Arrangements with USSPACECOM Pertaining to Launch
Phase
5.1.A
Establish contact with USSPACECOM to describe and discuss
all aspects of the launch including delivery and deployment
methodologies.

Space the deployment of multiple spacecraft in a way that
enhances the ability of USSPACECOM to quickly identify and
differentiate the spacecraft using the SSN.
5.1.C
Discuss the preparation of the R-15 launch form with
USSPACECOM so that they understand its contents and any
implications for safety of flight.
5.1.D
Ensure that the launch provider submits the Form 22 and launch
trajectory information to USSPACECOM, including
ephemerides for the powered-flight portions and orbital
elements for the parking orbits, so that potential colocation and
deconfliction potentialities can be discovered.
5.1.E
Provide to USSPACECOM as soon as possible launch-related
information (e.g., injection vectors and initial ephemerides for
deployed spacecraft) that can be used to assist with the
cataloging process, especially to confirm the identity of launchrelated objects. Coordinate a satellite numbering scheme
(potentially including temporary satellite numbers) appropriate
to the launch type and expected degree of cataloging difficulty.
5.1.F
Coordinate with USSPACECOM any potential launch anomaly
diagnostic products that can be provided if issues arise during
the launch and early orbit sequence.
5.2 CONOPS Discussions and Arrangements with USSPACECOM and NASA Pertaining to
On-Orbit Mission Phase
5.2.A
Register the spacecraft with USSPACECOM using the Satellite
Registration form on space-track.org.
5.2.B
Provide USSPACECOM with basic construction and mission
information about the satellite such as stowed dimensions;
deployable structures such as solar panels, antennae, booms,
including all their (rough) dimensions; satellite material
properties and colors; regular satellite attitude; and registered
operational radio frequencies.
5.2.C
Provide USSPACECOM with a basic overview of the satellite‚Äôs
orbit maintenance strategy including the paradigm for
determining when orbit maintenance maneuvers are required;
the maneuver technology used (as this relates to burn duration
and expected accuracy); and the frequency, duration, and
magnitude of typical burns.
5.2.D
Provide USSPACECOM with an understanding of the flight
control and navigation paradigm, principally whether a groundbased control approach is followed or some degree of (or full)
autonomous control is used. If the satellite control does include
some autonomous flight dynamics or control features, indicate

how much (if any) foreknowledge ground controllers have of
autonomous maneuver actions, the amount of information that is
communicated to the ground both before and after the maneuver
(e.g., maneuver time, delta-V, direction), and whether groundbased overrides are possible.
5.3 CONOPS Discussions and Arrangements with USSPACECOM and NASA Pertaining to
Conjunction Assessment
5.3.A
Decide whether the USSPACECOM free service, a validated
commercial conjunction assessment service, or both will be used
by the mission.
5.3.B
Establish a service with the selected service provider.
5.3.C
Implement a SSA sharing agreement with USSPACECOM to
receive advanced data support and services.
5.3.D
Through the registration of the satellite with USSPACECOM,
begin the process of arranging for conjunction analysis data
exchange including O/O ephemerides, maneuver notification
reports, and CDMs. USSPACECOM uses the space-track.org
account as the mechanism for product exchange.
5.3.E
If needed, complete an Orbital Data Request (ODR) form to
arrange for delivery of USSPACECOM advanced conjunction
analysis products.
5.3.F
For large constellations, coordinate with NASA and the
screening provider to identify and address any special
considerations.
5.4 In situ Launch Products and Processes
5.4.A
To aid in satellite tracking and identification, provide injection
vector(s) to USSPACECOM as soon as they are available.
5.4.B
To assist in spacecraft identification for the cataloging process
and provide general awareness among all O/Os, generate and
forward predicted ephemerides for the spacecraft to
USSPACECOM and publish the ephemerides (and all
subsequent ephemeris updates) publicly as soon as contact is
established with each deployed spacecraft.
5.4.C
If USSPACECOM has issued TLEs for launched objects, notify
USSPACECOM of the TLE and object number associated with
your spacecraft.
5.4.D
Provide early reporting to USSPACECOM of any spacecraft
failures or other operational difficulties, both to obtain any
available anomaly support and to assign the appropriate
conjunction assessment approach to the spacecraft (i.e., inactive
and thus handled in a manner equivalent to a debris object).

If using a commercial provider, make sure it has access to
information from items A-D.
6.0 On-Orbit Collision Avoidance

Comment

6.1 Spacecraft Information and Orbital Data Needed for Conjunction Assessments
6.1.A
Actively maintain the space-track.org record for the satellite,
updating the active/dead and maneuverable/non-maneuverable
flags to reflect the satellite‚Äôs current status.
6.1.B
Furnish predicted ephemerides that include state covariances to
USSPACECOM (and any additional commercial screening
provider) and set the privileges to allow any interested party to
access and download this information.
6.1.C
Furnished ephemerides should possess the following
characteristics:
a. Be of a 7-day predictive duration for LEO and 14 days for
other orbits;
b. Be issued at least at the following frequencies:
i. Three times daily for spacecraft with perigee
heights less than 500 km;
ii. Daily for other LEO orbits; and
iii. Twice weekly for other orbits.
c. Include all known maneuvers within the ephemerides‚Äô
prediction duration.
d. Provide ephemeris point spacing of approximately 1/100th
of an orbit, in either time or true anomaly. (Certain
scientific missions with extremely long orbits or high
eccentricities may require more specialized approaches).
e. Contain a realistic covariance at each ephemeris point for
at least the six estimated state parameters. (Appendix I
provides a practical guide for assessing covariance realism,
as well as some general principles for tuning the
covariance production process.)
f. Be formatted and distributed in the Consultative
Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standard
Orbital Ephemeris Message (OEM) ephemeris format,
preferably in the J2000 reference frame.
6.1.D
Furnish maneuver reports to USSPACECOM for any
trajectory-altering satellite maneuvers sufficiently in advance of
maneuver execution to enable an O/O evaluation of the
maneuver‚Äôs safety. Employ the standard maneuver reporting
message for this notification.

Appendix C. Best Practices List

61

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Section
6.1.E

Best Practice
When a maneuver becomes part of a satellite‚Äôs trajectory plan,
generate and submit to the screening provider an updated
ephemeris that contains this new maneuver as early as is feasible
but certainly with sufficient advance notice to enable an O/O
evaluation of the maneuver‚Äôs safety.
6.2 Conjunction Assessment Screenings
6.2.A
Submit predicted ephemerides for the spacecraft to a screening
provider to be screened for conjunctions at least daily with
spacecraft in higher-drag orbit regimes screened at least three
times per day.
6.2.B
Ensure that an O/O ephemeris for an active, maneuverable
spacecraft is screened against other ephemerides from active,
maneuverable spacecraft in near real time after any such
ephemeris is submitted to the screening provider.
6.2.C
Obtain and process these screening results from the screening
provider at the same frequency at which they are produced for
both the full-catalog and O/O vs O/O screening cases described
above.
6.3 Conjunction Risk Assessment
6.3.A
Use the Probability of Collision (Pc) as the principal collision
likelihood assessment metric.
6.3.B
Pursue mitigation if the Pc value exceeds 1E-04 (1 in 10,000).
6.3.C
Pursue mitigation if the estimated total miss distance is less
than the hard-body radius value.
6.3.D
Employ the current operational NASA Pc calculation
methodology for routine Pc calculation. Consider removing
correlated error from the primary and secondary object joint
covariance.
6.3.E
As a prioritization method for situations in which the number of
conjunctions meeting mitigation criteria exceeds the ability of
the O/O to mitigate, estimate the amount of debris that a
conjunction would produce if it were to result in a collision. A
less stringent Pc an order of magnitude lower could be
appropriate in such cases.
6.3.F
If employing USSPACECOM data products for conjunction
assessment, use the procedure given in Appendix P to
determine whether the data for a particular conjunction are
actionable and thus constitute a basis for conjunction
assessment-related decisions.

Appendix C. Best Practices List

Comment

62

Best Practices Handbook
Section
6.3.G

Best Practice
If a different conjunction assessment product provider is
chosen, develop and employ data actionability criteria for this
provider‚Äôs conjunction assessment information to determine
conjunction assessment event actionability.
6.4 Conjunction Risk Mitigation
6.4.A
When a conjunction‚Äôs Pc at the mitigation action commitment
point exceeds the mitigation threshold (recommended to be
1E-04), pursue a mitigation action that will reduce the Pc by at
least 1.5 orders of magnitude from the remediation threshold.
6.4.B
Ensure that an ephemeris containing the mitigation action is
screened against the full catalog, not a large screening volume
collection of CDMs.
6.4.C
Ensure that the mitigation action does not create any additional
conjunctions with a Pc value above the mitigation threshold (for
which the recommended value is 1E-04).
6.4.D
When the secondary object is an active, maneuverable
spacecraft, reach out to the secondary‚Äôs O/O and jointly
establish a way forward for the particular conjunction, including
deciding which spacecraft will maneuver and freezing the other
spacecraft‚Äôs planned trajectory until the TCA has passed.
6.4.E
Use space-track.org contact information to engage other O/Os.
6.5 Automated Trajectory Guidance and Maneuvering
6.5.A
When an onboard flight dynamics system computes any
maneuver to alter the satellite‚Äôs orbit for mission or conjunction
mitigation purposes, communicate maneuver details to the
operating ground control early enough to enable a
USSPACECOM screening and appropriate action in response to
the screening results.
6.5.B
Share maneuver plans with USSPACECOM both as a predicted
ephemeris with realistic covariance and, when possible, as a
maneuver report. Allow these notifications to be publicly
viewed and downloaded by any interested party.
6.5.C
Execute a maneuver as intended once a maneuver is
autonomously planned and externally communicated unless an
alteration is required for safety of flight.
6.5.D
Include the ability to pause or abort, for safety reasons, any
maneuver planned by the automated system, regardless of
whether the maneuver is planned by a ground system or on
board the satellite.

6.5.E

Best Practice
Ensure an automated maneuvering system can temporarily
suspend automatic conjunction assessment activities to allow
another operator to maneuver.
6.5.F
Rapidly submit a new ephemeris for screening if a maneuver is
not executed as planned in the original file sent for screening,
such as if a maneuver fails.
6.5.G
Keep spacecraft maneuverability status on space-track.org upto-date so other O/Os know whether any particular satellite is
capable of maneuvering.
6.5.H
If onboard flight dynamics planning is used, be able to
communicate back to operational secondary satellite O/Os that
the relevant information to enable a maneuver to mitigate a
conjunction between them is on board the satellite and will be
acted upon.
6.5.I
Request a larger-than-average screening volume from your
screening provider to ensure that the ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù of the space
catalog available to your satellites is broadly inclusive and thus
allows maneuver planning to take cognizance of all possible
hazards in choosing a new trajectory. This maximizes the
chances that, when screened before execution, the chosen
maneuver will be safe
6.6 Other Considerations
6.6.A
As part of spacecraft physical design and orbit selection,
perform a spacecraft photometric brightness analysis to
determine whether the spacecraft is likely to present an
impediment to ground-based astronomy. Consider changes to
the satellite‚Äôs construction, materials, or operating attitudes to
reduce expected photometric brightness to levels that will not
impede ground-based astronomy.
6.6.B
If a large constellation is being planned, either use a full BRDFbased photometric model or ground-based observations of actual
orbiting satellites, if available, to obtain a durable estimate of
the entire constellation‚Äôs expected brightness distribution as
deployed on orbit.
6.6.C
If the constellation, given its population, orbit, and constituent
satellites, is likely to affect ground-based astronomy, reassign
the satellite orbits or modify the satellite construction to
eliminate this effect.

3.2.C

Use USSPACECOM conjunction assessment service as a
minimum for screenings, even if additional commercial data or
services are used.
3.2.1.A Provide seven (7) days of predicted ephemeris (including
maneuvers) to USSPACECOM for screening for LEO spacecraft,
and provide 14 days for other Earth orbits; e.g., High Earth Orbit
(HEO)/Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO).
3.2.2.A Provide at least one ephemeris per day to be screened and three
ephemerides per day in the lower-drag LEO regime (perigee height
less than 500 km).
3.2.2.B Determine whether the O/O‚Äôs process for obtaining screening
results and performing conjunction risk assessment aligns with the
timeline of the USSPACECOM process. If the timelines do not
align in such a way as to enable timely and efficient screening
support, pursue a rearrangement of the O/O‚Äôs process to minimize
data latency and optimize screening efficiency.
3.2.3.A Populate and maintain the point-of-contact section on spacetrack.org with your operations contact data. Be sure that the
operations contact can be reached 24/7 due to time zone
differences between operators and the immediate nature of certain
conjunction assessment emergencies.
3.2.3.B Use standard ephemeris, CDM, and maneuver notification formats
defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems
(CCSDS).
3.3 NASA Partnership with USSPACECOM
3.3.A
Develop a robust safety-of-flight process that includes both
conjunction assessment screening and risk assessment to inform
close approach mitigation decisions

3.3.B

Large constellation operators should work with USSPACECOM
pre-launch to determine if variations from the standard approach
are necessary and, if so, to define a tailored screening process.
3.3.C
Large constellation operators should consider working with NASA
to define a risk assessment process. NASA is an experienced
representative operator. Including NASA in discussions regarding
establishing a conjunction assessment process will ensure that
the process will work with most operators for risk assessment
purposes.
3.4.2.A Owner/operators should conform to recommendations in the
NASA Technical Publication ‚ÄúAstrodynamics Convention and
Modeling Reference for Lunar, Cislunar, and Libration Point
Orbits.‚Äù
3.4.2.B Cislunar mission support entities (sensors, catalog maintainers,
etc.) should conform to the enhanced SSA message set (Butt 2021)
when creating cislunar SSA architectures.
3.4.2.C Owner/operators should maintain accurate orbit determination
solutions and predicted covariance for objects in cislunar space.
3.4.2.D Owner/operators should deliver predicted ephemeris with
covariance in the CCSDS format to space-track.org and to the
DSN SPS portal.
4.0 Spacecraft and Constellation Design
4.1 Ascent to/Disposal from the Constellation‚Äôs Operational Orbit
4.1.A
Perform a study to compute the number of expected close
approaches anticipated during ascent and descent as well as the
imputed additional satellite reliability that will be required to meet
satellite disposal requirements at the chosen operational orbit.

4.1.B

If the results of the study show a large burden, consider choosing a
different mission orbit with a lower burden.
4.1.C
All missions should review and follow the ODMSP guidance
standards.
4.1.D
When practicable, pursue active disposal using the fastest disposal
option available.
4.1.E
Recognize that transiting spacecraft should yield way to on-station
spacecraft and thus take responsibility for any conjunction risk
mitigation maneuvers or transient trajectory alterations that may be
required.
4.1.F
When planning descent using thrusters, if not planning an
approach of circular-orbit altitude reduction, coordinate with the
NASA JSC TOPO to ensure that perigee-lowering approaches do
not present persistent and problematic orbital crossings with the
ISS and other human space flight assets.
4.2 General Orbit Selection: Debris Object Density
4.2.A
Include considerations of orbital debris density when selecting
candidate mission orbits. Debris density diagrams, indexed by
object size, are published by the NASA Orbital Debris Program
Office (ODPO). (See Appendix G for more information and
examples.)
4.2.B
When choosing from the final set of candidate orbits, perform a
conjunction frequency analysis to determine the number of
conjunction assessment high-interest events per spacecraft per year
that can be expected in each of the proposed orbital areas.

4.3 Vehicle and Constellation Specific Orbit Selection: Spacecraft Colocation
4.3.A
During orbit selection, perform an orbit colocation analysis to
determine whether any of the proposed orbits is likely to create
systematic conjunctions with existing actively maintained
satellites.
4.3.B
If the orbit colocation analysis identifies systematic conjunctions,
consider modifying the proposed orbit(s) slightly to eliminate this
possibility. Optimizing orbit placement may be appropriate.
4.3.C
If the selected orbit is likely to present systematic conjunctions
with a pre-existing spacecraft, then coordinate with the other
operator(s) to arrange a process to coordinate maneuver plans
routinely during the life of the mission.
4.4 Launch-Related Conjunction Assessment
4.4.A
Protect human space flight assets from close approaches during the
COLA gap using stand-off distance or statistical measures.
4.4.B
Conform to additional LCOLA requirements that the launch range
may impose.
4.5 Spacecraft Trackability
4.5.A
Through selection of physical design and materials, ensure that the
satellite is trackable by SSN from deployment until demise.
a. For spacecraft with perigee heights less than 2000 km, the
spacecraft should have characteristic dimensions of at least 10
cm in each major dimension.
b. For spacecraft with perigee heights greater than 2000 km, the
spacecraft should have characteristic dimensions of at least 50
cm in each major dimension.
c. If the spacecraft cannot meet these dimension constraints, use
a proven detectability enhancement.

altitudes, ensure that the spacecraft is trackable at all altitudes.
4.6 Spacecraft Reliability
4.6.A
Ensure that spacecraft reliability is high enough that the likelihood
of each spacecraft remaining fully functional until it can be
disposed of meets or exceeds 99%.
4.6.B
Reassess the 99% analysis whenever the underlying assumptions
change; for example, extending operations beyond design life or
failures in key systems.
4.6 Development of Capabilities for Ephemeris Generation and Conjunction Risk Assessment and Mitigation
4.7.A
Develop and implement a capability to generate and share accurate
predicted spacecraft ephemerides including any planned
maneuvers. (See Section 3.1 for a discussion of ephemeris sharing
for screening. See Section 6.2 for specific guidance on ephemeris
generation frequency, length, point spacing, formatting, and
contents.)
4.7.B
Determine during spacecraft design what risk mitigation
approaches are possible for the spacecraft. While trajectory
modification via thrusting maneuver is the most common
approach, other approaches such as differential drag orbit
modification are possible.
4.7.C
Develop and implement or arrange to acquire a capability to
process CDMs and to compute conjunction risk assessment
parameters such as the Pc.
4.7.D
Develop and implement or arrange to acquire a risk analysis
capability to select mitigation actions that will lower the Pc for
dangerous conjunctions to a user-selected value.

As a prioritization method for situations in which the number of
conjunctions meeting mitigation criteria exceeds the ability of the
O/O to mitigate, estimate the amount of debris that a conjunction
would produce if it were to result in a collision. A less stringent
Pc an order of magnitude lower could be appropriate in such
cases.
6.3.F
If employing USSPACECOM data products for conjunction
assessment, use the procedure given in Appendix P to determine
whether the data for a particular conjunction are actionable and
thus constitute a basis for conjunction assessment-related
decisions.

If a different conjunction assessment product provider is chosen,
develop and employ data actionability criteria for this provider‚Äôs
conjunction assessment information to determine conjunction
assessment event actionability.
6.4 Conjunction Risk Mitigation

When a conjunction‚Äôs Pc at the mitigation action commitment
point exceeds the mitigation threshold (recommended to be

least 1.5 orders of magnitude from the remediation threshold.
6.4.B
Ensure that an ephemeris containing the mitigation action is
screened against the full catalog, not a large screening volume
collection of CDMs.
6.4.C
Ensure that the mitigation action does not create any additional
conjunctions with a Pc value above the mitigation threshold (for
which the recommended value is 1E-04).

that, when screened before execution, the chosen maneuver will be
safe.
6.6 Other Considerations
6.6.A

spacecraft photometric brightness analysis to determine whether
the spacecraft is likely to present an impediment to ground-based
astronomy. Consider changes to the satellite‚Äôs construction,
materials, or operating attitudes to reduce expected photometric
brightness to levels that will not impede ground-based astronomy.

If the constellation, given its population, orbit, and constituent
satellites, is likely to affect ground-based astronomy, reassign the

Appendix E. Use of Analytic Theory Orbital Data in
Conjunction Assessment
The following is an amplification of a statement made by the Conjunction Assessment Technical
Advisory Committee in 2016 on the use of analytic theory for conjunction assessment, and in
particular the Two-Line Element (TLE) set publicly accessible catalog produced by
USSPACECOM.
Due to enormous increases in computational capacity over the last twenty years, the space
surveillance industry has been able to transition from analytic to higher-order theory approaches
to space catalog maintenance. This transition brings a number of significant advantages to
modern space catalogs such as the modeling of additional perturbations that were not typically
represented in analytic theories (e.g., solar radiation pressure and solid earth tides), an improved
fidelity in modeling the major perturbations (e.g., geopotential and atmospheric drag), and a
durable covariance matrix to accompany each state estimate. Some of these features existed with
previous analytic and semi-analytic theories, but it is only in recent times that all the additional
attributes are routinely produced and available for space surveillance applications. This
development has prompted the question of how data from analytic models (such as the
Simplified General Perturbations Theory #4 [SGP4], which is used to produce the publicly
available TLE catalogs) and higher-order theory models (such as the USSPACECOM Special
Perturbations (SP) Space Object Catalog, although higher-order theory data can also be furnished
from other sources) should be employed in the conjunction risk assessment process.
Risk assessment, whether it is quotidian consumer risk, the extremely serious discipline of
nuclear accident risk, or the present problem of satellite collision risk, must always contain
within its calculus some determination of the likelihood of occurrence of the event in question.
For CA, this determination is most commonly assessed by calculating the Probability of
Collision (Pc; see Appendix I for a development of the calculation theory), and this calculation
requires both the state estimates for the primary and secondary objects and the accompanying
measures of these estimates‚Äô uncertainties, typically through a covariance matrix, at the time of
closest approach (TCA).
Most implementations of analytic orbital theories lack the ability to produce a meaningful
covariance (this is true of the SGP4 TLEs), so they cannot enable a probabilistic conjunction
assessment calculation and thus for conjunction assessment applications will yield only a miss
distance at the time of the two objects‚Äô TCA. Because no uncertainty information on this miss
distance is provided, no probabilistic conclusion can be drawn. A miss-distance threshold can be
(arbitrarily) selected to enable a binary ‚Äúsafe / not safe‚Äù conjunction evaluation, but there is no
ability to determine, for example, how often the real miss distance, for which the nominal miss
distance is only an estimated mean value, is actually likely to exceed or fall below such a
threshold. No probabilistic assessment of whether a conjunction will be a dangerously close
encounter is possible, so the likelihood of occurrence of a collision cannot be determined.
This dynamic is illustrated in Figure E-1, which gives a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
plot of miss distance distributions, both for critical (Pc > 1E-04) and non-critical (Pc < 1E-04)
Appendix E. Use of Analytic Theory Orbital Data in Conjunction Assessment

81

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
events. The lack of any strong correlation between Pc and miss distance is clear: the span of miss
distances for the critical events (less than 100 m to more than 10 km) is extremely broad and
overlaps significantly with the results for the non-critical events. For example, to eliminate 95%
of the high-Pc events using a miss-distance criterion alone, a 10 km miss-distance threshold
would need to be chosen‚Äîa value that would also include more than 50% of the non-worrisome
events, creating a density of events to mitigate so great that an unsustainable number of such
mitigation actions would be required.

Figure E-1 Miss-Distance Distributions for Critical (Pc > 1E-04) and
Non-critical (Pc < 1E-04) Events
Additionally, the inherent theory error in general perturbation approaches makes them ill-suited
for even a risk-tolerant, miss-distance-based conjunction assessment. A published study (Hejduk
et al. 2013) provided TLE accuracy information for the two methods presently used by
USSPACECOM to generate them: traditional SGP4 orbit determination and Extrapolated
General Perturbation (eGP) TLE generation, which performs the SGP4 orbit determination not
against sensor measurements but against pseudo-observations generated from a higher-order
theory trajectory for the object, which includes some forward prediction of the trajectory. Both
methods are in use presently to generate the publicly-released TLE catalog, and it is not always
easy to determine which method was used to produce any given TLE. Performance data for the
orbital regime corresponding to Figure E-1 above (LEO with perigee heights greater than 500
km) are given in Figure E-2. These results show that, while the eGP methodology outperforms
traditional SGP4 as expected, both are noisy in the epoch to 72-hour propagation states, which is
the time-frame during which most conjunction risk mitigation decisions are made; errors from
600 m to 3 km are observed.

distributions for events with both Pc > 1E-03 and, separately, 1E-02. Figure E-3 suggests that a
miss-distance criterion of several hundred meters, or perhaps 1-2 km, could be used as a
simplified method of performing a risk-tolerant conjunction assessment: remediate any
conjunctions with a miss distance less that 1-2 km. This move is ill-advised because it would
result in a huge number of unnecessary mitigations (as an example, for events with a miss
distance less than 1 km, the number with a Pc less than 1E-03 and thus not serious is six times
greater than the number with a Pc greater than 1E-03). In addition, the inherent theory error (600
m to 3 km, from above) is a substantial portion of the miss-distance threshold of 1-2 km that
would be imposed‚Äîin some cases even greater than the threshold itself. So even under the very
limited case described here, the use of general perturbation results for conjunction risk
assessment is not tenable. Thus, analytic theory data, such as that contained in the public TLE
catalogs, should not, taken alone, serve as a basis for risk assessment decisions and subsequent
mitigation actions.

Nonetheless, analytic theory orbital data, usually furnished as TLEs, does have its uses in
conjunction assessment; some of these have included the following:
‚Ä¢

Mission planning activities such as the selection of satellite future orbits and final
disposal orbits;

‚Ä¢

General situational awareness information such as the positions of neighboring objects
and the general effects of the basic perturbations (e.g., atmospheric drag);

‚Ä¢

Pre-filtering of candidates for conjunction assessment screenings for which simple TLEbased filters can eliminate substantial numbers of candidate pairs from requiring explicit
screening runs;

‚Ä¢

Assessment of the status of a payload that appears as a conjuncting secondary, as active
secondaries require special analysis and alerting when performing conjunction
remediation; and

‚Ä¢

Consistency checks of the higher-order theory data. While the higher-order theory data
are typically more accurate, they themselves are vulnerable to updates with bad or
inadequate tracking data, errors in force model and integration control settings, and
incorrect maneuver solutions. Comparisons with the analytic data can often identify such
problems and, while not enabling their repair, can at least make clear that such cases
constitute non-actionable conjunction assessment data.

Although the above uses of analytic theory data can be tangentially helpful to the conjunction
assessment enterprise, these uses do not themselves directly support conjunction risk assessment,
for which more accurate state estimate data accompanied by uncertainty information is required.

Appendix F. Expected Conjunction Event Rates
The conjunction assessment workload that a mission experiences is a function of:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

The total number of CDMs that it receives,
The number of associated events with risk levels high enough to require enhanced
monitoring, and
The number of events that have a risk level so high as to require mitigation planning and
potential execution.

During mission planning and development, it is helpful to have a general idea of the frequency of
such situations to model spacecraft fuel consumption, identify staffing needs, and determine the
appropriate degree of conjunction assessment-related tool automation.
The following profiling of conjunction assessment event densities is intended to provide at least
some first-order information to answer these questions. These data summarize three years‚Äô recent
conjunction assessment data history for the payloads that NASA protects in the LEO orbit
regime (event densities in the non-LEO region are both low and highly dependent on the specific
orbit, so summary information is not given here). In November 2021, Russia conducted a kinetic
anti-satellite (ASAT) test that destroyed a derelict Russian satellite at approximately 480km,
which generated an additional 1500 cataloged debris fragments in LEO. This increase is reflected
in the three-year averages given below, although by 2024 most of these fragments will have
decayed.
The graphs presented in Figure F-1 contain several component parts.
The x-axis gives the hard-body radius for the conjunction, which is essentially the combined
sizes of the primary and secondary objects. Although different methods are used to determine
this size, perhaps the most common is to construct a circumscribing sphere about the primary
object and add its radius to a standard radius size for the type of secondary object (i.e., payload,
rocket body, or debris) in the conjunction (Mashiku and Hejduk 2019). Hard-body radius (HBR)
values of 20 m, 10 m, 5 m, 2 m, 1 m, and 0.1 m are used, the last few values included to give
some statement of the expected situation for small satellites. All the CARA events were
reprocessed with these different HBR values to produce these varied results.
The y-axis gives the number of expected events per payload per year, shown on a logarithmic
scale, with the type of event indicated by the color in the stacked bar charts, which are to be read
in the following way:
‚Ä¢

The height of the red bar indicates the frequency of red events, which are defined as
events containing at least one CDM with a Pc value > 1E-04. These are the most serious
events; they require detailed monitoring, mitigation planning, and in a minority of cases,
the actual execution of a mitigation action.

‚Ä¢

The height of the yellow bar indicates the frequency of yellow events, which are defined
as events containing at least one CDM with a Pc value > 1E-07. These events generally
merit increased monitoring and attention, including in some situations, mitigation

Appendix F. Expected Conjunction Event Rates

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

planning (if they are close to the red threshold). Based on the definition above, all red
events are also yellow events.
‚Ä¢

The height of the green bar indicates the frequency of events of any type, including those
that never manifest a Pc > 1E-07. Based on this definition, all red and yellow events are
also green events.

The overall height of each bar thus indicates the CDM generation rate. Note that this number,
while in some ways a useful loading figure, is a function of the size of the screening volume that
is employed and thus is not that meaningful in itself. For a screening volume similar in size to
those used by NASA CARA, the green event generation rates (which include the yellow and red
events) are likely to be similar. Because they require relatively small miss distances, the yellow
and red generation rates are expected to be largely independent of the screening volume size
selected as long as the volume used is reasonably-sized.
Three different graphs are presented representing three different regions of LEO sorted by
perigee height (p): a high-drag regime (p < 500 km), a low-drag regime (perigee height between
500 and 750 km) that includes a large concentration of satellites somewhat higher than 700 km,
and a second low-drag regime from 750 to 1400 km. There are moderate differences in event
frequency among the three different regimes, although some of that variation may be due to the
different levels of sampling among the three, given that NASA operates substantially different
numbers of payloads in each of these three regions. These results are more notional than precise;
nonetheless, they do give some level of orientation to the expected loading for each event type
(green, yellow, and red).

Appendix G. Orbital Debris Density
Orbital debris can be generated by a number of processes that have conspired to produce the
present debris environment:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Detritus cast off as part of the launch and injection activities;
Off-scourings from healthy satellites themselves, such as peeling of Mylar thermal
insulation;
Collisions between satellites;
Explosions of satellites; and
Satellite debris-generating events in which (without any clear cause) a satellite is
observed to break into more than one piece.

Because of the orbital locations in which major debris-producing events have taken place, and
due to the differences in efficiency of natural debris cleansing arising from varying drag at these
different altitudes, orbital debris density is not uniform. It is thus helpful to examine the current
debris density situation when choosing an operational orbit because the orbital debris density
does influence the rate of close approach events as well as the likelihood of satellite damage due
to collision with an object too small to be tracked.
The graphs in Figure G-1 are produced from the NASA Orbital Debris Engineering Model
(ORDEM) 3.2 release developed by the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office (ODPO).
Generated for the 2023 debris environment, these graphs give debris flux (per satellite unit area
and time on orbit) as a function of orbital altitude (a circular orbit is presumed) and inclination.
Given that satellites often have many years of orbital lifetime, it could be argued that the graphs
should be projected further forward in time and thus reflect debris generation events and natural
debris depletion processes over as much as the next decade. However, such a prediction requires
a stochastic execution of the model to try to guess at the number, severity, and location of future
debris-producing events. Since the purpose here is to compare the relative debris densities of
different regimes, the simplicity of a single rather than probabilistic presentation has been
selected.
The graphs are arranged by inclination, and while it is observed that the highest inclination band
represented here does have a slightly higher debris density than the two lower bands, the
differences in both absolute debris flux values and the overall curve morphology among the three
inclination bands are not great, indicating that inclination is not a major contributor to debris
density. However, variation with orbital altitude is more marked: the density peaks at about 850
km and tails off in either direction from that peak at relatively equal rates. And the reduction is
significant: about an order of magnitude in each direction within the bounds of the graphs (400 to
1200 km orbital altitude).
Three lines are shown on each graph:
‚Ä¢

The amber line represents objects of sizes greater than 10 cm, which is the size of objects
in the present space catalog without any contributions from the new Space Fence SSN
radar and is thus related to satellite conjunctions presently tracked and reported.

Appendix G. Orbital Debris Density

88

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

The reddish line is for objects of sizes greater than 5 cm, which is the size of objects that
can be expected to be included in a catalog that does include tracking data from the new
Space Fence radar, which should soon be contributing data to the conjunction assessment
enterprise.
The blue line is for objects of sizes greater than 1 cm, which is the size of objects large
enough to be generally considered lethal to a satellite if there is a collision.

The gap between the reddish and blue lines thus represents the flux level of objects that are too
small to be tracked yet large enough to potentially be lethally damaging. The gap represents a
collision risk that, essentially, cannot be mitigated and so is simply accepted as the cost of
operating a satellite in space.

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

In some cases, the flux densities between the 1 cm and 5 cm bands represent almost an order of
magnitude difference. Considering this difference, some might question why conjunction
assessment is pursued at all, given that so much of the collision risk cannot be remediated and
simply must be accepted. To this question are two distinct responses:
1. First, within reasonable bounds, it makes sense to protect against safety-of-flight hazards
that are known and that can, if necessary, be mitigated. NASA CARA‚Äôs statement of
purpose is ‚Äúto take prudent measures, at reasonable cost, to enhance safety of flight,
without placing an undue burden on mission operations.‚Äù An unjustified over-investment
in safety should be avoided, and mission objectives should not be regularly and
substantially impaired by conjunction assessment considerations. But since it is not
particularly expensive or difficult to identify high-risk conjunctions from the existing
space catalog, and since such conjunctions are relatively infrequent, and furthermore,
since the need for mitigation action for such conjunctions is less than an order of
magnitude less frequent than that, it is good safety practice to conduct conjunction
assessment operations according to the CARA mission statement. Space actors thus
employ the conjunction assessment enterprise to ‚Äúprevent the preventable.‚Äù
2. Second, the satellite conjunctions that occur between objects large enough to be in the
space catalog are the ones that have the potential to generate large amounts of space
debris. As the NASA ODPO has shown (Johnson et al. 2001), the debris production
potential of a collision is a function of the two objects‚Äô relative kinetic energy and
masses: the ratio of their two masses and their relative velocity. Collisions in which the
two objects‚Äô masses are quite different will generally result in only the lighter of the two
objects being fragmented with the heavier object being merely cratered. Objects in which
the two masses are closer to each other will generally result in complete fragmentation of
both objects and thus very large amounts of resultant debris. Extremely small secondary
objects (i.e., a few centimeters in size and thus below the level of trackability), even at
the large relative velocities of LEO conjunctions (~10,000 m/s), are quite unlikely to
cause fragmentation of larger active payloads, so the amounts of debris produced by
collisions with untracked objects will in almost all cases be relatively small. As stated
previously, collisions with untracked objects can still be lethal to a satellite and do
constitute an accepted risk simply of operating a satellite in space, but conjunction
assessment against tracked and cataloged objects prevents the collisions that will produce
large amounts of debris and thus makes a substantial contribution to space sustainability,
even though it cannot protect payloads from debilitating conjunctions with very small
objects. (Appendix O gives a more detailed treatment of the collision debris production
topic.)
Choosing a mission trajectory that occupies a region of space with a lower debris density is thus
a favorable selection for two reasons:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

It lowers the risk of a lethal collision with an untracked object; and
In general, it reduces the rate at which serious conjunctions with cataloged objects will
occur.

Appendix G. Orbital Debris Density

91

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
In addition to achieving the above two goals (as the curves in Figure G-1 demonstrate), choosing
orbits with lower orbital altitudes also facilitates compliance with the 25-year disposal
guidelines.
While there may be a general correlation, it is important to recognize that there is not in fact a
direct relationship between the debris flux for catalog-size objects and the actual rate at which
conjunctions, even serious conjunctions, will be identified. The debris flux gives the expected
frequency of penetration of the satellite‚Äôs cross-sectional area by some object in space.
According to the curves in Figure G-1, a sun-synchronous object at 700 km, placed at the middle
of a 20 m radius sphere (to employ an extremely conservative statement of its exposed area),
would over a one-year period expect only 0.006 penetrations of this 20 m sphere. In other words,
it should take ~160 years on orbit for a penetration to occur. However, predicted close
approaches for such an object are identified daily, yet mitigation actions would be warranted
only a few times per year. What is the meaning of this lack of alignment?
When a Pc for a specific event is calculated, it is interpreted as representing the likelihood that
the ‚Äútrue‚Äù miss distance (which ultimately cannot be known) is smaller than the hard-body radius
(HBR) defined about the object (e.g., the 20 m radius of the constructed sphere described in the
above paragraph). The ‚Äútrue‚Äù Pc corresponding to the ‚Äútrue‚Äù miss distance is either 0 or 1; i.e.,
either the satellites will pass within 20 m of each other or they will not.
However, the orbit determination process does not predict future positions without error, so a Pc
value somewhere between 0 and 1 represents a calculation of the likelihood of a penetration
given the uncertainties in the input measurement data to the orbit determination, lack of
comprehensiveness of the dynamical model, and additional uncertainties expected in predicting
the satellites‚Äô epoch states to their TCA (such as atmospheric density forecast error).
Generally, when the Pc is greater than 1E-04 (1 in 10,000 likelihood of a penetration), a
mitigation action is recommended and executed, This threshold has emerged in the industry as an
acceptable balance between safety-of-flight considerations and additional mission burden and
encumbrance. Because mitigation actions are recommended when the likelihood of penetration
exceeds 1 in 10,000, there is little surprise that the frequency of serious conjunction events
exceeds that projected by the debris flux value: in only 1 out of 10,000 cases would the
penetration actually occur if the mitigation action were not executed. Fortunately, a conservative
approach such as this can be implemented and is still consistent with the mandates of prudent
action, reasonable costs, and lack of undue burden on mission operations.
(See Appendix F for information on actual expected rates of serious conjunction events.)

Appendix H. Long-Term Collision Risk and Satellite
Colocation Analysis
This section describes an approach developed by NASA CARA that uses long-term collision risk
assessment methodologies applied to proposed satellites to predict:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Long-term average conjunction and collision rates that a new satellite can expect to
experience; and
The potential frequency of repeating conjunctions experienced by a new satellite due to
being colocated with another satellite.

These methods provide the means to avoid deploying new satellites into crowded regions of
orbital space, and to prevent orbital collocation with one (or more) pre-existing satellites.
Although the methods also apply to satellite mid-mission repositioning or end-of-life disposal
efforts, they are demonstrated here using an example of a newly-proposed satellite.
With the ongoing deployment of large constellations, such as the Starlink or OneWeb systems,
avoiding overly crowded regions of space is becoming an increasingly important consideration.
In addition, avoiding orbital colocation prevents problematic repeating conjunctions with other
active satellites. To this end, when a new operational orbit is being selected, a long-term collision
risk and orbit colocation analysis should be performed. Fortunately, it is often possible to make
sufficient modifications to an intended nominal orbit to avoid these unfavorable situations, yet
still meet mission objectives.

H.1 Long-Term Risk Assessment Theory and Algorithmic Description
Both semi-analytical and Monte Carlo methods provide the means to estimate statisticallyexpected long-term collision rates between satellites. Monte Carlo methods also provide
estimates of the overall expected frequency of conjunctions, as well as the frequency of repeating
conjunctions which can be used to identify potentially colocated satellites.
Analytic Long-term Collision Rate Analysis
The analytic theory developed by Kessler (1981) focuses on estimating collision rates between
either spherical objects, or, for this application, circumscribing spheres. It provides estimates of
such collision rates by neglecting all orbital perturbations except the orbital precession induced
by Earth‚Äôs J2 gravitational term (see Vallado 1981 for a description of orbital precession). For
each pair of analyzed satellites, the Kessler rate represents an average over six angles (Hall and
Matney 2000). More specifically, the method averages collision rates over the three Keplerian
orbital element angles for each of the two interacting objects. These three angles are the orbital
right ascension of ascending node (RAAN, or Œ©), the argument of perigee (ùúî), and the mean
anomaly (ùëÄ). In other words, Kessler rates represent six-dimensional phase space averages,
which are equal to long-term temporal averages in idealized situations for which the ergodic
hypothesis is valid. For this reason, Kessler rates are often referred to as ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù estimates,
even when calculated in more realistic, non-idealized situations to which the ergodic hypothesis
does not necessarily strictly apply.
Appendix H. Long-Term Collision Risk and Satellite Colocation Analysis

93

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
The Kessler (1981) formulation expresses the average collision rate between two satellites as an
integral over the volume of their overlapping orbital regions, as follows:
ùëÅÃáùëêùêæ = ùúé1,2 ‚à´ [ùëÜ1 ùëÜ2 ùë£ùëüùëíùëô ]ùëëùëâ

(H-1)

ùïç

In this equation, ùïç indicates the overlapping orbital volume shared by the primary and secondary
satellites; ùúé1,2 = ùúã(ùëÖ1 + ùëÖ2 )2 their combined collisional cross section; ùëÜ1 and ùëÜ2 their average
spatial densities, respectively; and ùë£ùëüùëíùëô their average relative velocity during conjunction events.
(The superscript K indicates that the Kessler method has been used to estimate the collision rate,
and the dot above the symbol Nc represents the first time derivative.) The Kessler collision rate is
zero for orbits that do not cross one another at all over long-term J2-only propagations, for which
the overlap volume ùïç vanishes. The integrand factors within the square brackets of equation (H1) depend on first three Keplerian orbital elements of the primary and secondary satellite orbits,
i.e., the semi-major axis (SMA), the eccentricity, and the inclination of each. Calculating the
integral over volume in equation (H-1) entails two-dimensional numerical integration over
geocentric latitude and radial distance.
Monte Carlo Colocation Conjunction Rate Analysis
Monte Carlo methods provide another means to estimate collision and conjunction rates, and
allow for more generalities, including:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Trajectories that account for orbital perturbations other than just those induced by the J2
gravitational term;
Both spherical and non-spherical shapes, used to estimate conjunction rates that arise
from ellipsoidal or box-shaped screening volumes; and
The ability to estimate the frequency of repeating conjunctions, used to assess satellite
colocation.

The CARA Monte Carlo long-term rate estimation software uses the U.S. Space Force‚Äôs
Computation of Miss Between Orbits (COMBO) astrodynamics standards algorithm to
determine close approaches between trajectories propagated using the SGP4 orbital theory. Input
consists of a two-line element (TLE) set of mean orbital elements for the primary object plus a
file of multiple TLEs for the secondary objects being considered. Each Monte Carlo trial entails
propagating trajectories over a duration of several days (typically seven or ten), beginning each
propagation at the epoch of the TLE catalog. The initial mean orbital elements for the trial
propagations are the same as specified by the input TLEs, except that newly sampled (ùúî, Œ©, ùëÄ)
angles are generated for both objects, each randomly drawn from a uniform distribution spanning
0 to 2ÔÅ∞. The Monte Carlo algorithm registers a ‚Äúhit‚Äù for each instance that the trial trajectories
approach one another close enough to penetrate a screening volume surrounding the primary
object. For sufficiently large screening volumes, multiple hits can potentially occur per trial, so
the algorithm also registers the earliest hit that occurs for each primary-secondary pair as a ‚Äúfirstcontact‚Äù event.

Appendix H. Long-Term Collision Risk and Satellite Colocation Analysis

94

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

Dividing the total number of hits by the product of the number of trials and the propagation
duration yields the Monte Carlo estimate for the rate

ùëÅ‚Ñéùëñùë°

(H-2)

The second equation above provides an approximation of the 1-sigma uncertainty of the estimate
due to Monte Carlo counting uncertainties, which decreases as the number of registered hits
increases. Rates of first-contact events are similarly calculated and are always less than or equal
ùëÄùê∂
to the overall rate, i.e., ùëÅÃáùëìùëê
‚â§ ùëÅÃáùëêùëÄùê∂ . As demonstrated later, for colocated orbits that produce
mostly repeating conjunctions, the rate of first-contact conjunctions is significantly less than the
total rate.

H.2 Long-Term Risk Assessment Methodology Demonstration
To demonstrate long-term risk and satellite colocation assessments, this section introduces a
hypothetical proposed satellite called ‚ÄúNewSat‚Äù with a nominal initial orbit intentionally
designed to be colocated with that of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
In this hypothetical scenario, NewSat has a hard-body radius of 3.5 m, and is to be launched and
reach its mission orbit on 2022-11-18 00:00:00 UT. The mean orbit of HST at this epoch,
propagated from a TLE cataloged shortly before that time, has a mean motion equal to
15.11279168 revs/day, an eccentricity of 0.0002381, and an inclination of 28.4696ÔÇ∞ ‚éØ
corresponding to an equatorial perigee altitude of about 530.6 km and an apogee altitude of
532.2 km. To create a colocated orbit for this demonstration, the TLE for NewSat‚Äôs nominal
orbit has been made identical to that of HST in all respects except that the inclination has been
rounded to the value of 28.5ÔÇ∞ and the eccentricity increased to 0.001. (These changes prevent the
two orbits from being identical but are not sufficiently large to prevent them from being
colocated, as will be demonstrated later.) This nominal NewSat deployment orbit corresponds to
an equatorial perigee altitude of about 523.7 km and an apogee of 537.5 km, which is 13.8 km
higher than perigee. However, for this hypothetical scenario, NewSat is given the flexibility to
deploy into an alternate orbit with the same inclination, but with perigee altitudes anywhere from
500 to 600 km, and with an apogee up to 20 km higher than perigee. As discussed below, the
long-term risk assessment methodology estimates rates between NewSat and HST over this
entire region of orbital parameter space, as well as for all the other satellites contained within the
2022-11-18 TLE catalog, which represent a total of 36,368 potential secondary objects, a
population that includes active and retired satellites, spent rocket-bodies, and orbital debris.
Figure H-1shows a plot of Kessler collision rates between NewSat and HST, calculated with
equation (H-1), and using hard-body radii of 3.5 m and 10 m for the two satellites, respectively.
Specifically, the plot shows the collision rate (on the color axis), as a function of perigee altitude
(horizontal axis) and apogee-perigee difference (vertical axis). The white star marks NewSat‚Äôs
nominal deployment orbit. However, as mentioned previously, NewSat could deploy into an
alternate orbit at any location within the bounds of the plot. Unsurprisingly, the nominal orbit
corresponds to a non-zero long-term collision rate between the NewSat and HST. However,
much of the area on the plot corresponds to zero collision rate (shown as the darkest blue color
Appendix H. Long-Term Collision Risk and Satellite Colocation Analysis

95

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
on the plot); these regions represent candidate orbits for NewSat that do not overlap at all with
HST‚Äôs orbit because they are sufficiently higher or lower in altitude. NewSat could change
deployment plans by shifting its orbit into one of these regions, but that would only mitigate the
long-term collisional threat due to HST and not necessarily that posed to the other cataloged
satellites.

Figure H-1 Kessler Collision Rates between NewSat and HST
Figure H-2 shows collision rates summed over all the satellites contained within the full 202211-18 TLE catalog. For the nominal NewSat orbit marked by the white star, a total of 2,183
secondary objects were found to have non-zero Kessler rates among the 36,368 cataloged
objects. The calculation uses hard-body radii for these secondary objects taken from a table of
published dimensions for known satellites, when available, and based on radar cross section
values for unknown objects such as orbital debris (Hall and Baars 2022). Figure H-2 shows that
the nominal NewSat orbit is adjacent to (but not within) the region affected by the Starlink
constellation satellites, which occupy several orbital shells at higher altitudes (the regions
affected by three of these shells are marked in Figure H-2). So, if the NewSat mission were to
change its deployment plans, doing so to avoid these already crowded regions would largely
eliminate the expected number of Starlink conjunctions and associated risk mitigation actions.
For clarity, Figure H-3 shows collision rates for all cataloged objects, but with Starlink
constellation satellites excluded. A comparison of the color axis scales on Figures H-2 and H-3
illustrates how relatively large the long-term rates due to the Starlink constellation are in this
specific region of orbital space.

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Figures H-1, H-2, and H-3 graphically illustrate how long-term collision rate analyses can be
used to avoid deploying satellites into crowded regions, and thereby help minimize the long-term
collision risk among tracked objects. For the nominal deployment orbit, Figure H-2 indicates that
NewSat‚Äôs predicted collision rate is ~6ÔÇ¥10-4 per year, corresponding to a statistically expected
collisional ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù (expected time until a collision) of ~1,700 years among cataloged satellites.
(As mentioned previously, other physical effects such as active maneuvering, orbital decay, etc.,
are likely to occur on shorter timescales than this, meaning that the ergodic hypothesis does not
strictly hold for this system; nevertheless, long-term collision rates and collisional lifetimes are
still used in these situations as indicators of statistical risk.) Notably, shifting NewSat‚Äôs
deployment orbit into one of the regions most affected by the Starlink constellation would lead to
a significantly shorter collisional lifetime of 30 to 100 years‚éØin the absence of any risk
mitigation maneuvering, which fortunately is being performed by Starlink constellation satellites.
However, a careful inspection of Figures H-1, H-2, and H-3 indicates that changing the planned
NewSat deployment to an orbit with a mean equatorial perigee altitude of about 558 km and an
apogee ‚â§7 km higher would avoid both the HST and Starlink regions simultaneously and extend
NewSat‚Äôs collisional lifetime to ~3,000 years. Furthermore, an extended analysis that includes all
future Starlink constellation deployments (as tabulated by Bassa et al. 2022) indicates that the
collision rate predicted for this specific orbital region should remain relatively low, at least
among currently cataloged objects and currently planned Starlink satellites.

H.3 Colocation Analysis Methodology
During their on-orbit residence, most spacecraft come into conjunction with other, secondary,
objects with some frequency. However, if two active satellites are maintained in similar orbits or
in orbits that have consistent intersections, synodic alignment can occur that produces multiple
close approaches on successive orbits. If the alignment is very close, such repeating conjunctions
can persist over extended periods (e.g., much longer than typical seven- or ten-day conjunction
screening durations) and could also recur periodically over a satellite‚Äôs entire orbital lifetime.
Because conjunction management between active payloads is complex, requiring coordination of
maneuver plans and joint decisions about near-term courses of action, it is desirable to minimize
such situations.
In the example introduced in the previous section, the nominal NewSat orbit was constructed
specifically to be highly colocated with HST‚Äôs orbit. This section demonstrates how Monte Carlo
analysis can be used to identify such colocated orbits, which are characterized by a high
frequency of repeating conjunctions, or, equivalently, a relatively low frequency of first-contact
conjunctions. For this, the Monte Carlo method is used to predict the average rate of
conjunctions and the fraction expected to be first-contact events. This specific analysis estimates
conjunction rates averaged over a screening period of seven days (which is the same screening
duration used for most LEO CARA satellites). Conjunctions occur in the Monte Carlo simulation
when an ellipsoidal screening volume centered on the primary satellite is penetrated by the
trajectory of a secondary satellite. The ellipsoid used for the present analysis has principal axes
that measure 2ÔÇ¥25ÔÇ¥25 km, aligned with the primary object‚Äôs radial, in-track and cross-track
directions.

The goal of colocation analysis is to determine the orbital conditions that create repeating
conjunctions, which can be accomplished by analyzing the frequency of first-contact events. As
mentioned previously, first-contact conjunctions correspond to the initial instance that a
conjunction screening volume is penetrated. This means that pairs of satellites that experience
high frequencies of repeating conjunctions necessarily have low first-contact conjunction rates
relative to their total conjunction rates. The colocation analysis graph in Figure H-4 demonstrates
this effect by comparing total conjunction rates and first-contact rates, plotted as a function of
‚àÜùëé, which represents the offset of NewSat‚Äôs orbital semi-major axis (SMA, or a) from its
nominal value. (Note, the analysis assumes that NewSat‚Äôs eccentricity and inclination remain at
their nominal values of 0.001 and 24.5ÔÇ∞, respectively). The black dashed curve marked with
circles in Figure H-4 plots the total conjunction rate, ùëÅÃáùëêùëÄùê∂ , calculated using equation (H-2). This
total includes both first-contact conjunctions and any subsequent conjunctions (i.e., repetitions).
ùëÄùê∂
The red dotted curve marked with diamonds plots the first-contact rate, ùëÅÃáùëìùëê
, which is always
less than or equal to the total rate. The black curve shows that conjunctions of either type are
predicted to occur for SMA offsets within about ÔÇ±10.5 km of the nominal deployment value, i.e.,
in the range -10.5 km ‚â§ ‚àÜùëé ‚â§ +10.5 km. However, the red curve indicates that the rate of firstcontact conjunctions is noticeably lower than the total over the range -6.1 km ‚â§ ‚àÜùëé ‚â§ +6.1 km.
Furthermore, the first-contact rate is less than 50% of the total rate over the more restricted range
of -2.2 km ‚â§ ‚àÜùëé ‚â§ +2.2 km.

This analysis adopts this 50% reduction (i.e., ùëÅÃáùëìùëê
/ùëÅÃáùëêùëÄùê∂ < 0.5) as a means to identify highly
colocated orbits, meaning that, for this specific screening volume and under these conditions,
NewSat would need to shift its deployment SMA by at least 2.2 km in either direction from the
nominal value to avoid a high level of colocation with HST. Notably, shifting by about 6.1 km
would largely eliminate the occurrence of repeating conjunctions, but would not prevent all
conjunctions between the two satellites. The one-dimensional analysis shown in Figure H-4
assumes only SMA orbital adjustments, holding the deployment eccentricity and inclination
constant at their nominal values. A similar two-dimensional analysis holding only the inclination
constant can also be performed to determine how much the SMA and/or eccentricity would need
to change to eliminate high levels of colocation (or, equivalently, how much the perigee and/or
apogee altitudes would need to change). The generalized method can be extended to even higher
dimensions to include all relevant, adjustable orbital elements.

If the NewSat mission were to change the planned deployment orbit to avoid colocation with
HST, as described above, then it would be worthwhile to do so in a manner that does not result in
it being collocated with any other high value satellites. For example, the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope (FGST) and the Swift satellite, both NASA missions, occupy orbits similar to
NewSat‚Äôs nominal proposed orbit, so it is conceivable that shifting the NewSat deployment orbit

could inadvertently create a high level of colocation with one of these satellites. Figures H-5 and
H-6 demonstrate this by showing one-dimensional colocation analysis graphs for FGST and
Swift, respectively (each made using the same assumptions as described above for Figure H-4).
Figure H-5 shows that FGST‚Äôs red curve with diamonds is less than half of the black curve with
circles for -7.0 km ‚â§ ‚àÜùëé ‚â§ -2.5 km, so if NewSat were to shift into this range, then the analysis
predicts it would become highly colocated with FGST. Similarly, Figure H-6 indicates that
shifting NewSat‚Äôs orbit into the range +7.8 km ‚â§ ‚àÜùëé ‚â§ +12.4 km would result in high colocation
with the Swift satellite.

H.4 Long-Term Conjunction Rate and Colocation Analysis Software
The NASA CARA software instantiation of the long-term risk and colocation analysis capability
is an ongoing tool development effort, currently being refactored to execute faster (which is
especially required for the Monte Carlo analysis modes), and eventually to be more portable
(because it currently uses the U.S. Space Force COMBO tool, which has restricted distribution).
The main CARA software tool entitled ‚ÄúLongTermRisk‚Äù uses TLE catalogs as input and allows
users to estimate long-term Kessler collision rates as well as Monte Carlo conjunction rates and
associated first-contact rates. (The LongTermRisk tool was used to create all the figures shown in
this appendix.) The tool also has the capability to ingest auxiliary TLE catalogs containing
predicted future satellite constellation(s), for instance, or model populations of untracked orbital
debris. Because the tool uses the limited-distribution AstroStandands version of the U.S. Space
Force COMBO close approach analysis function, and because the associated execution
environment is relatively complicated to set up, it is envisioned that the ability to run this tool
will remain within the NASA CARA organization.

Appendix I. Satellite Covariance Realism Assessment
Procedures
I.1 Introduction
This section outlines standard methods for assessing the realism of a covariance produced as part
of the state estimates for a spacecraft. Because probability-based methods for satellite
conjunction risk assessment in almost all cases require a covariance for their calculation, realistic
covariances for both the primary and secondary objects in a conjunction are important.
The U.S. Space Force has pursued algorithmic improvements over the last twenty years to
improve the realism and representativeness of their catalog‚Äôs covariance matrices, especially in
LEO, so covariances that arise from this source have undergone efforts to assess and sustain their
trustworthiness. For covariances produced for and contained in satellite O/O ephemerides, the
situation is much more uneven. While it is true that in the majority of conjunctions the
covariance for the secondary object predominates, in 5% of the conjunctions the primary
covariance is larger than the secondary, meaning that it is likely to play a substantial role in
collision likelihood assessment in over 10% of conjunctions. This is a large enough subset of a
satellite‚Äôs conjunction history to make covariance realism for the primary object ephemeris an
important consideration.
Because the focus of this section is more practical than theoretical, broader questions of
covariance formation, methods of covariance propagation, or approaches within the orbit
determination process to improve covariance realism are not addressed in detail. Modern orbit
determination packages, such as the Ansys Orbit Determination Tool Kit, include features for
covariance formation, propagation, and tuning, and their accompanying technical documentation
is extensive.
What this section does attempt to do is enumerate the data types needed for covariance realism
investigations, introduce the appropriate test statistics, and give some guidance for the evaluation
and interpretation of these tests. Most of the information here derives from NASA CARA‚Äôs
practical experience with this problem, as there are few published studies on the subject and no
practical guides. The particular focus is on determining the realism of predicted covariance
generation for actively maintained spacecraft in the presence of precision position data (e.g.,
onboard GPS or telemetry tracking information) to use for a realism assessment because this is
the particular situation presented to O/Os.
Covariance realism assessment consists of three parts: collection/calculation of position error
data, calculation of covariance realism test statistics, and proper assessment of those test
statistics. After some introductory discussion, each of the three parts of this process will be
addressed in detail.

I.2 General Remarks
It is important to recall that a spacecraft state estimate generated through an orbit determination
process is an estimate of a mean state (i.e., mean position and mean velocity), and a covariance is
Appendix I. Satellite Covariance Realism Assessment Procedures

103

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
a stochastic characterization of the expected errors about that mean state. The governing
assumption is that these errors in the individual components conform to a Gaussian distribution;
this is how a covariance matrix alone is able to represent the error distribution without requiring
higher-order tensors. The activity of covariance realism is thus to determine how well actual
state errors conform to the Gaussian distribution that the covariance specifies. Such a statement
requires additional remarks.
First, the present treatment focuses on the assessment of the realism of the position portion of the
covariance, although in most cases the methods advanced here are applicable to a full 6 x 6 or
even larger covariance matrix. There certainly are reasonable arguments for evaluating the
covariance in element space (usually equinoctial elements) and considering all six elemental
representations in any evaluation (Woodburn and Tanygin 2014). However, since the principal
purpose of covariance generation at present is for conjunction assessment applications, and for
many conjunction risk assessment approaches only the position portion of the covariance is used
(typically to calculate the probability of collision employing the two-dimensional simplification
of the situation; see Chan 2008), it is acceptable to limit oneself to a Cartesian representation of
the covariance and focus only on its position portion. Furthermore, a previous study has
demonstrated that potential non-Gaussian covariance behavior brought about by working in a
Cartesian rather than curvilinear framework rarely affects the outcome of higher-probability
conjunction events, namely those with Pc values greater than 1E-04 (Ghrist and Plakalovic
2012). Given all of this, limiting the analysis to the position portion of the covariance is
reasonable.
Second, because a covariance represents an error distribution, its adequacy as a representation
can be evaluated only by examining a set of actual error data and determining whether these data
conform to the distribution specified by the covariance. In actuality, this is usually not possible
in a straightforward way because a particular covariance is propagated to a particular point in
time and relevant only at that moment, and at that moment there is only one state estimate and
thus only one error point. It is not possible to determine in any definitive way whether a single
point conforms to a distribution; one can determine a percentile level for that point (e.g., for a
normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, absolute values of 3 or greater should
occur only 0.13% of the time) and discern that such points will not occur frequently in such a
distribution, but they will occur occasionally, and the situation in the above example may well be
one such instance. Typically, this problem is addressed by generating a test statistic that
compares each error point to its associated covariance, determining what the distribution of such
test statistics should be, and evaluating the conformity of the set of test statistics to the expected
distribution. More will be said about this in the following sections that directly address the
calculation of test statistics and evaluation of their statistical properties.
Third, as stated in the previous paragraph, a covariance is always a covariance propagated to a
particular time. If it is not propagated at all, it is an epoch covariance and is purported to reflect
the error of the fit;12 if it is propagated, it is intended to be a reflection of the state estimate error

12

It is questionable whether the a priori covariance emerging from the batch process does indeed do this as it is
produced by a calculation that involves only the amount of tracking, times of the tracks, and a priori error variances

104

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
of that propagated state. Many different covariance propagation methods are available, each of
which achieves a different level of fidelity, so one source of covariance irrealism can be the
propagation method itself. It is thus important to group realism evaluations by propagation state;
for example, all the calculated test statistics for covariances propagated from 1.5 to 2.5 days
could be collected into a single pool and evaluated as a group, and the evaluation could be said to
be applicable to covariances propagated about two days. It should also be pointed out that
covariance irrealism, however it may be evaluated, is unlikely to correlate directly with
propagation time in the sense that if the covariance is made realistic for a particular propagation
state, it cannot necessarily be expected to be realistic for all propagation states. When pursuing
covariance realism remediation, one frequently needs to decide whether some sort of omnibus
improvement over all common propagation states is desired or whether it is preferable to focus
on a particular propagation state or narrow ranges of states. Many aspects of the U.S. Space
Force‚Äôs orbit determination process are tuned to optimize performance at 3 days‚Äô propagation;
this is not a terrible propagation state to choose for O/O covariance realism optimization for
conjunction assessment applications, although one could also choose a somewhat shorter value if
that were to align more closely with maneuver commitment timelines.
Fourth, in the context of a covariance error calculation, the individual state error values will need
to be presumed to constitute independent samples, free of correlation between them. Such an
assumption is common in most statistical processes, and it is not surprising to see it arise here.
While true sampling independence is unlikely to be achieved, there are certain measures that can
be taken to promote it. For example, if one has set up a covariance realism assessment scenario
by comparing a predicted ephemeris (with covariance) to a definitive ephemeris, it would be best
to take only one point of comparison for each propagation state bin that one wishes to evaluate.
For example, in evaluating the two-day propagation state, there would be a temptation to take all
of the ephemeris points from, say one hour before the two-day propagation point to one hour
after that. If the ephemeris were generated with one-minute time steps, then this would produce
120 points instead of just one, which on the surface would seem to give a nice sample set for a
statistical evaluation. However, because the propagated and definitive ephemeris points are
highly correlated, in fact little additional information is brought to the evaluation by including
the entire dataset. Additionally, all of the statistical evaluation techniques that will be deployed
to generate a realism evaluation assume sample independence; in such a case as the one
described above, they will miscarry and produce what is likely to be an overly optimistic result.
In the present scenario, it is best to limit oneself to a single comparison point per propagation
state from this pair of ephemerides and seek out a group of such ephemeris pairs rather than use
closely grouped data points from them to try to broaden the sample set.
The procedure recommended above eliminates a particular strain of correlation, but it leads
naturally to the consideration of a second type: that between successive ephemerides. Definitive
ephemerides are generally formed by piecing together sections of ephemeris from essentially the
middle of the fit-spans of moving-window batch orbit determinations, and filters process data
sequentially but with a forgetting-rate matrix that reduces the influence of older data as a
for each observable. It does not give a statistical summary of the actual correction residuals. For this reason, some
practitioners have argued for an alternative formulation of the covariance that considers residual error.

function of data age. But in each case, a fair amount of time between ephemerides needs to pass
before the generated points are statistically independent of a given predecessor set. The
independence condition could be fulfilled by forcing the generation of products from entirely
different datasets, but this is not a practical procedure. In past projects, trying to reduce the data
overlap to less than 50%, meaning that subsequent ephemerides to be used in covariance realism
evaluations need to be spaced so that they share less than 50% of the generating data with the
previous ephemeris, has been considered acceptable in practice, although a lower figure would
be desirable. One need not become overly fastidious about this issue, but it is important to take
whatever practical steps one can to reduce the influence of sample data correlation on the realism
assessment.

I.3 Part I: Error Computation
Satellite state errors are computed by comparing a predicted state estimate to some type of state
truth source. The predicted data typically come from a predicted ephemeris with a predicted
covariance associated with each ephemeris point. Truth data can come from a variety of sources:
onboard GPS precision position data, precision telemetry tracking data, or a precision ephemeris
constructed from either of these. Ideally, both the predicted and truth data should align
temporally (i.e., their time points should be exactly the same), and they should both possess
covariance data at each time point. In actuality, it is rare that both of these conditions are met,
and often neither is.
Covariance data are often not available for the truth data source. Precision tracking or GPS data
can include covariance information as an output from a tracking or combinatorial filter; when
precision ephemerides are constructed, sometimes covariances can be synthesized from the
abutment differences observed between the joined ‚Äúpieces‚Äù of ephemeris. However, it is
frequently the case that even when this is theoretically possible, the construction software has
failed to include this as a feature. If no covariance data are available for the truth source, one
must then determine whether the errors in the truth data are so much smaller than the errors in
the predicted ephemeris under evaluation that the errors in the truth data can safely be neglected.
The degree of accuracy difference that would allow this assumption is a matter of opinion, but
most commentators would probably agree that an order of magnitude difference would be an
acceptable decrement; and in some cases, even smaller ratios could be tolerated. These
differences, however, must be considered at the individual component level. If the error in one
component tends to dominate the entire arrangement (as is often encountered with the in-track
component due to inadequate drag modelling), then the overall normalized error of all three
position points in the truth ephemeris can be much smaller than the overall error in each point in
the predicted ephemeris, yet component errors for the cross-track and radial components could
be of a similar magnitude in both truth and prediction. In such a case, the omnibus test statistic to
be described in the next section would be distorted because it treats the normalized errors in each
component essentially equally.
If the time-points between truth and predicted data do not align, then some sort of intermediatevalue-determination scheme must be used for one of the two datasets. The highest-fidelity
approach would be to use an actual numerical propagator to produce aligning values, but if the
points for the source to be adjusted are spaced sufficiently closely, then a number of different
Appendix I. Satellite Covariance Realism Assessment Procedures

106

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
interpolation approaches produce results quite adequate for a covariance realism assessment.
While the interpolation of state values is relatively straightforward and can be accomplished
satisfactorily with different interpolation approaches (e.g., Lagrange, Hermite), the interpolation
of covariances is much more problematic. Different interpolation methods appear to work better
in different situations; there is no single accepted method to compare multiple covariances to
evaluate their relative fidelity against each other, and there is a danger of certain interpolation
methods producing non-positive-definite covariances, which do not make physical sense with the
current problem. Given this situation, if both data sources (truth and prediction) can be
interpolated, but only one of the two data sources possesses accompanying covariance data
(presumably the predicted source), then it is usually preferable to interpolate the data source that
lacks the covariance, for this eliminates the question of how to handle covariance interpolation.
If both sources possess covariance, then one would in general interpolate the source with the
closer point spacing. Alfano (2004) outlines certain covariance interpolation techniques and
provides test results. There is also an interest in interpolating not the covariance, but the state
transition matrices associated with the straddling ephemeris points. While this approach can in
some cases produce slightly less desirable interpolated covariances, it does essentially guarantee
that the interpolated result will be positive definite.
Once position and covariance data for the predicted and truth datasets are aligned at the timepoint of interest, calculation of the error is straightforward: it is simply the (subtracted)
difference between states as long as they both are rendered in the same coordinate system. The
subtraction convention does not actually matter given the way the test statistic is computed, but
for consistency, one can follow the ‚Äúobserved ‚Äì expected,‚Äù or truth ‚Äì prediction, paradigm. The
two covariances for each comparison point (one for the truth position and one for the predicted
position) are simply added together, presuming, of course, that they are in the same coordinate
system. Thus, for each point of comparison, one will have a position difference (with three
components) and a corresponding combined covariance (or just the predicted source‚Äôs
covariance if the truth source‚Äôs errors are presumed to be extremely small).
While one can conduct an entire covariance realism evaluation in the Earth-Centered Inertial
(ECI) reference frame, it is often more meaningful to move it into the Radial ‚Äì In-track ‚Äì Crosstrack (RIC, which is also called the UVW) frame‚Äîa reference frame that is centered on the
object itself. If only one of the evaluation data sources has an associated covariance, then it
probably makes sense to make that source the center for the RIC coordinate frame. If a
covariance is provided for both, then it does not really matter which is selected to ground the
RIC frame. The use of the RIC frame is helpful in moving from a finding of irrealism to
remediation suggestions.

I.4 Part II: Test Statistic Computation
As stated previously, a position covariance, which in this treatment is the portion of the matrix to
be tested for proper error representation, describes a three-dimensional distribution of position
errors about the object‚Äôs nominal estimated state, and the test procedure is to calculate a set of
these state errors and determine whether their distribution matches that described for the position
covariance matrix. To understand the test procedure, it is best to consider the problem first in one
dimension, perhaps the in-track component of the state estimate error. Given a series of state

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

estimates for a given trajectory and an accompanying truth trajectory, one can calculate a set of
in-track error values, here arranged in vector form and given the designation Œµ, as the differences
between the estimated states and the actual true positions. According to the assumptions
previously discussed about error distributions, this group of error values should conform to a
Gaussian distribution. As such, one can proceed to make this a ‚Äústandardized‚Äù normal
distribution, as is taught in most introductory statistics classes, by subtracting the sample mean
and dividing by the sample standard deviation:
ÔÅ• ‚àíÔÅ≠
ÔÅ≥

(I-1)

This should transform the distribution into a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1, a so-called ‚Äúz-variable.‚Äù Since it is presumed from the beginning that the
mean of this error distribution is 0 (because the state estimate is an estimate of the mean and is
presumed to be unbiased), the subtraction as indicated in the numerator of Equation I-1 should be
unnecessary, simplifying the expression to:
ÔÅ•
ÔÅ≥

(I-2)

It will be recalled that the sum of the squares of n standardized Gaussian variables constitutes a
chi-squared distribution of n degrees of freedom. As such, the square of Equation I-2 should
constitute a one-degree-of-freedom chi-squared distribution. This particular approach of testing
for normality‚Äîevaluating the square of the sum of one or more z-variables‚Äîis a convenient
approach for the present problem, as all three state components can be evaluated as part of one
calculation (Œµu represents the vector of state errors in the radial direction, Œµv the in-track direction,
and Œµw the cross-track direction):

ÔÅ• u2 ÔÅ• v2 ÔÅ• w2
+ 2 + 2 = ÔÅ£ 32dof
2
ÔÅ≥u ÔÅ≥v ÔÅ≥w

(I-3)

One could calculate the standard deviation of the set of errors in each component and use this
value to standardize the variable, but it is the covariance matrix that is providing, for each
sample, the expected standard deviation of the distribution. Since the intention here is to test
whether this covariance-supplied statistical information is correct, the test statistic should use the
variances from the covariance matrix rather than a variance calculated from the actual sample of
state estimate errors. For the present moment, it is helpful to presume that the errors align
themselves such that there is no correlation among the three error components (for any given
example, it is always possible to find a coordinate alignment where this is true, so the
presumption here is not far-fetched; it is merely allowing that that particular coordinate
alignment happens to be the RIC or UVW coordinate frame). In such a situation, the covariance
matrix would lack any off-diagonal terms and thus look like the following:

What is appealing about this formulation is that, as the covariance becomes more complex and
takes on correlation terms, the calculation procedure need not change: the matrix inverse will
formulate these terms so as properly to apportion the variances among the U, V, and W
directions, and the chi-squared variable can still be computed with the ŒµC-1ŒµT formulary. For such
a situation in two-dimensions (chosen here for illustrative purposes because the expression is less
complex) in which the error quantities are Œµx and Œµy and the correlation coefficient is œÅ, the entire
equation, with correlation terms included, assumes the form:

One can observe that if the correlation coefficient is zero, the equation reduces to the twodimensional equivalent of the form shown in Equation I-7 above. As the correlation coefficient
moves from zero to a more substantial value, the test statistic encounters a trade-off between the
overall inflating effect of the (1-œÅ) multiplier and the subtracted correlation term.
The quantity ŒµC-1ŒµT is called the Mahalanobis distance (technically, it is the square of the
Mahalanobis distance), named after the mathematician P.C. Mahalanobis (who, by the way, was
a personal friend of the 20th-century mathematical genius Ramanujan). This construct is a
convenient and useful way to calculate a normalized distance.

I.5 Part III: Test Statistic Evaluation
It is very well that a test statistic can be derived that, if the covariance is realistic, should
conform to a known statistical distribution, but of course, there needs to be some method for
testing a group of these test statistics to determine if in fact they do conform to the expected
distribution. Such a desire leads the investigation to the statistical subdiscipline of ‚Äúgoodness of
fit.‚Äù
Every student of college statistics learns about Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), the particular
procedure for determining whether two groups of data can essentially be considered the same or
different. More particularly, it is a procedure for determining whether the experimental
distribution, produced by the research hypothesis, can be considered to come from the parent
distribution represented by the null hypothesis, and the operative statistic arising from the
analysis is the p-value: the likelihood that the research dataset can be considered a sample drawn
from the null hypothesis‚Äôs parent distribution. If this value becomes small, such as only a few
percent, it means that there are only about two or three chances in one hundred that the
experimental dataset would have been generated from sampling from the null hypothesis dataset.
In this case, the research and the null hypothesis outcomes can be considered to be palpably
different, which would be likely to lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis and the embrace of
the research hypothesis. This procedure is a specific example of statistical hypothesis testing.
A similar procedure can be applied to evaluate goodness of fit, namely, to evaluate how well a
sample distribution corresponds to a hypothesized parent distribution. In this case, the general
approach is the reverse of the typical ANOVA situation: it is to posit for the null hypothesis that
the sample distribution does indeed conform to the hypothesized parent distribution, with a low
p-value result counseling the rejection of this hypothesis. This approach does favor the
association of the sample and the hypothesized distribution, which is why it is often called
‚Äúweak-hypothesis testing‚Äù. Although counterintuitive, this approach is not unreasonable: what is
being sought is not necessarily the ‚Äútrue‚Äù parent distribution but rather an indication of whether it
is reasonable to propose the hypothesized distribution as the parent distribution for the
experimental data that one has generated or calculated. In the present case, the question to be
posed is whether the observed squared Mahalanobis distance histories, calculated by the
procedure in Part II, conform to a 3-degree-of-freedom chi-squared distribution, namely, whether
they can be considered to have been drawn from a 3-degree-of-freedom chi-squared distribution
as a parent distribution‚Äîif they do, then the covariance properly represents the actual observed
error distribution.
There are several different mainstream techniques for goodness-of-fit weak-hypothesis testing:
moment-based approaches, chi-squared techniques (not in any way linked to the fact that the
present application will be testing for conformity to a chi-squared distribution), regression
approaches, and Empirical Distribution Function (EDF) methods. The easiest and most direct of
these is simply a test of the first moment of the distribution (that is, the mean), which, if
normalized by the degrees of freedom of the distribution, should be unity (or, in the present case,
should take on an unnormalized value of 3). The square root of this mean, the so-called
Mahalanobis distance, is a good estimate of a single-value scale factor describing the covariances
departure from reality, and as such, it is a convenient way to compare the results from different
Appendix I. Satellite Covariance Realism Assessment Procedures

covariance correction techniques as well as estimate a single-value scale factor that could
potentially be used to remediate an irrealism situation.
While this test is easy to apply and expeditious for generating comparative results, in comparison
to other goodness-of-fit tests it lacks power. Indeed, many different distributions could have the
same mean yet be substantially different in the overall behavior or in the tails: a close match of
the mean is a necessary but not sufficient condition for matching a distribution. To evaluate the
match between entire distributions, the EDF methodology is generally considered to be both the
most powerful and most fungible to different applications. For this reason, it does not make
sense to apply formal goodness-of-fit tests to first-moment results (i.e., matching of the mean);
these should be used merely as a methodology to compare performance for the corrected versus
uncorrected cases and intra-correction-methodology performance.
The general EDF approach is to calculate and tabulate the differences between the Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) of the sample distribution and that of the hypothesized distribution,
to calculate a goodness-of-fit statistic from these differences, and to consult a published table of
p-values for the particular goodness-of-fit statistic to determine a significance level. Specifically,
there are two goodness-of-fit statistics in use with EDF techniques: supremum statistics, which
draw inferences from the greatest deviation between the empirical and idealized CDF (the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics are perhaps the best known of these); and quadratic statistics,
which involve a summation of a function of the squares of these deviations (the Cram√©r ‚Äì von
Mises and Anderson-Darling statistics are the most commonly used). It is claimed that the
quadratic statistics are the more powerful approach, especially for samples in which outliers are
suspected, so it is this set of goodness-of-fit statistics that are recommended for covariance
realism evaluations. The basic formulation for both the Cram√©r ‚Äì von Mises and AndersonDarling approaches is of the form:
ÔÇ•

Q = n ÔÉ≤ ÔÅõFn ( x) ‚àí F ( x)ÔÅù ÔÅπ ( x)dx
2

‚àíÔÇ•

(I-9)

The two differ only in the weighting function œà that is applied. The Cram√©r ‚Äì von Mises statistic
is the simpler:

ÔÅπ ( x) = 1

(I-10)

setting œà to unity. The Anderson-Darling is the more complex, prescribing a function that
weights data in the tails of the distribution more heavily than those nearer the center:

ÔÅπ ( x) = ÔÅªF ( x)ÔÅõ1 ‚àí F ( x)ÔÅùÔÅΩ

‚àí1

(I-11)

The Anderson-Darling construct is thus more sensitive to outliers. Given NASA CARA‚Äôs
experience that outliers frequently creep into covariance realism evaluations and introduce
statistical processing issues, it is recommended to choose the somewhat more permissive
Cram√©r ‚Äì von Mises statistic for covariance realism investigation purposes.

Appendix I. Satellite Covariance Realism Assessment Procedures

111

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
It is a straightforward exercise to calculate the statistic in Equation I-9, discretized for the actual
individual points in the CDF for each trajectory (that is, changing the integral into a summation),
and for convenience, this quantity is called the ‚ÄúQ-statistic.‚Äù The step after this is, for each
Q-statistic result, to consult a published table of p-values (determined by Monte Carlo studies)
for this test to determine the p-value associated with each Q-statistic (a good source for these
tables as well as an excellent treatment of the overall subject is given in D‚ÄôAgostino and
Stephens 1986). The usual procedure is to set a p-value threshold (e.g., 5%, 2%, 1%) and then to
determine whether the sample distribution produces a p-value greater than this threshold
(counseling the retention of the null hypothesis: sample distribution conforms to hypothesized
distribution) or less than this threshold (counseling rejection of the null hypothesis: sample
distribution cannot be said to derive from the hypothesized distribution as a parent). One can also
interpolate to determine the precise p-value for each test situation. NASA CARA has source
code and test cases that perform all the above calculations and reside on the NASA CARA
public-facing software repository for free download (See Section 7, Contact Information in this
document for the specific URL.)
Finally, it should be noted that, even though there are normalization provisions within the EDF
formulation, the results do, to some degree, depend on the size of the sample. In a way this is
considered already by accommodation within the p-value tables for sample size, but because of
the quadratic-sum nature of the test statistic, the procedure can still be overwhelmed by large
sample sizes. One approach to mitigating this situation is to pick a standard sample size‚Äî
perhaps somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 samples‚Äîand calculate the test statistic in a
(with-replacement) resampled manner, producing a CDF of the p-values attained for each
sample. As an example, suppose that for a particular evaluation there are 100 error vectors with
associated covariance and therefore 100 test statistic (ŒµC-1ŒµT) results. When running the
goodness-of-fit test, one might choose 1000 random, 50-point samples (with replacement) from
this set of 100 values and test each, producing a CDF chart of the 1000 p-values obtained from
the resampling investigation.
What is an acceptable level for a p-value result‚Äîone that would indicate that the error
distribution matches that of the covariance? In goodness-of-fit practice, rarely is a significance
level greater than 5% required, and levels of 2% or even 1% are often accepted. It probably can
be said that values less than 1% cannot allow the conclusion that there is any real conformity to
the hypothesized distribution. At the same time, it should be added that the calculation is rather
sensitive to outliers and that this should be kept in mind when interpreting results.
If results from different remediation approaches match the hypothesized distribution closely
enough, then comparison of different p-value levels can serve as a notional indication of the
relative performance of these different approaches. However, if the performance is such that the
hypothesized distribution is not approached all that closely by any of the correction mechanisms,
then a situation can be encountered in which the results fall off the published tables of
p-values, and it becomes extremely difficult to compare the results of the different methods
conclusively. In such a case, it may be possible to draw some broad comparative results from
looking at the Q-values rather than the associated p-values, but in all likelihood, it will be
necessary to revert to simply a comparative-results set such as first-moment tests.

I.6 Part IV: Data Outliers and Conditioning
As remarked in the above section, goodness-of-fit test results can be sensitive to outliers; this is
true whether one interprets results visually or uses a formal technique. The deleterious impact on
test results is mitigated somewhat using the resampling approach discussed previously, by which
the contribution of the outliers to each individual test is lessened. However, the fact remains that
bad data do enter the orbit determination process, and the failure to take some account of this
reality can produce situations in which the covariance realism assessment problem becomes
intractable.
The entire covariance realism assessment process is grounded on the notion that individual
component errors are normally distributed, and this situation allows for certain techniques to
identify outliers. The usual ‚Äúx-sigma‚Äù filter is a na√Øve and unscientific method for outlier
identification and is especially difficult to justify for the Gaussian distribution, where there is
some developed theory for outlier identification. A superior approach is the Grubbs outlier test,
which provides a formal statistical test for outliers but works only in situations with a single
outlier and cannot be applied recursively (Grubbs 1969). In the case of multiple outliers, the
procedures of Rosner (1975, 1977) are applicable but must be applied with an a priori guess of
the number of potential outliers. That is, one must first inspect the data to assemble a proposed
set of outliers and then test this group as outliers for a particular significance level. Because only
a single component can be assessed at a time, to use this approach it is probably best to design a
tool that can examine a particular error point‚Äôs behavior in all three components (compared to the
rest of the main distribution) to determine which set of points might constitute an outlier set and
test that set. Several such attempts may be needed before a set of points can be identified as
outliers to a given significance level.
An extended example of the application of the technique described here is available in Zaidi and
Hejduk (2016).

Appendix J. CARA Conjunction Risk Assessment Tools
Validation
CARA and JSC FOD are chartered to perform conjunction assessment screenings, risk
assessment, and mitigation action guidance on behalf of NASA missions, so typically there is no
particular need for missions to obtain or develop conjunction risk assessment evaluation tools.
However, cases can occasionally arise in which it is not practical or desirable for CARA/JSC
FOD to perform these calculations, such as for potential autonomously controlled missions that
will perform onboard conjunction assessment. In such cases, the needed calculations or tools will
be validated by CARA/JSC FOD before operational use. Methods used for validation include the
following:
‚Ä¢

Inspection. Used to verify that a particular datum or feature is present, that a display or
graphic is properly constructed to convey a particular concept, etc.

‚Ä¢

Analysis/Documentation. Used to ensure that a particular algorithm is theoretically or
practically sound, that a needed parameter is properly converted to a different reference
frame or units, etc.

‚Ä¢

Formal Test. Used to ensure that critical calculations are performed correctly by
executing a formal test with preconfigured input data and expected results, which are
compared to the test article‚Äôs results and any differences satisfactorily explained.

Appendix L. Commercial Data in NASA Conjunction
Assessment
The breadth and quality of commercial SSA data has developed in the last decade from
essentially no commercial presence at all to the presence of a number of different vendors, each
specializing individually in radar, optical, or passive radio frequency satellite tracking. In
addition to tracking measurement data, vendor offerings now include additional SSA products
such as vectors, ephemerides, and even conjunction risk assessment analysis outputs such as
Conjunction Data Messages (CDMs).
In examining and facilitating the use of commercial data in NASA conjunction risk assessment
calculations, CARA and JSC FOD adhere to the following principles:
1. Use raw observation (measurement) data only and combine with Space Surveillance
Network (SSN) observations for a single solution
2. Validate all non-SSN data
3. Undertake a cost/benefit analysis before purchasing commercial SSA data
More details on these principles are described below.

L.1 Use raw observation (measurement) data only and combine with
SSN observations for a single solution
Of all the data types offered by commercial providers, only the raw satellite tracking data are at
present fully and unambiguously of use to the NASA conjunction assessment enterprise.
Because NASA has access to both the USSPACECOM satellite tracking data from the SSN and
the USSPACECOM space catalog maintenance operational system, NASA has the ability to
include raw commercial observation data along with SSN tracking data into a combined close
approach prediction. This process involves combining all of the measurement data on an object
of interest from both the SSN and commercial sources to perform a single orbit determination.
The predicted close approaches can then be calculated from this combined source. The CARA
and JSC FOD personnel who are embedded in the 18 SDS work center at VSFB presently have
this capability in a ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù area on the operational system that is not used for routine
operations. The sandbox area enables CARA/JSC FOD operators to combine the SSN and
commercial data in a native and compatible way to produce a single risk assessment solution that
can be acted upon unambiguously.
Work is also progressing on a regularization of the reception of commercial data into the 18 SDS
enterprise; when such a capability is in place, conjunction assessment products deriving from
combined commercial and DOD tracking data will be possible routinely. But receiving higherlevel products from commercial vendors, such as vectors or even conjunction assessment outputs
like CDMs, introduces multiple solutions into the enterprise and creates significant operational
difficulties in trying to adjudicate among them.

Appendix L. Commercial Data in NASA Conjunction Assessment

118

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Event evaluation in the presence of multiple solutions
There is presently a debate within the industry regarding the best way to proceed with event
evaluation in the presence of multiple solutions. CARA/JSC FOD encounters a version of this
situation in miniature each day in that most conjunction events possess two solutions: one that
uses the DOD predicted position for the primary object state and a second that uses the O/O
predicted ephemeris for that state. Counterintuitively, it is not always clear which of these two
sources for the primary object predicted state is superior.
O/Os typically have more and better past position data on their satellite, either from telemetry
tracking or onboard GPS fixes, and they also understand the configuration of their satellite better
and thus should be able to calculate the components of the ballistic coefficient with more
precision. The O/Os should then be able to come up with a better epoch solution on which to
base prediction, and they are positioned to do a better job in prediction as well because they
potentially possess a superior ballistic coefficient. However, O/O orbit determination software
atmospheric density models often introduce more error into predicted states than the model used
by the 18 SDS.
In the situation that CARA faces, the choice of a preferred data source is thus not straightforward
because a number of factors influence the selection: the capabilities of the O/O‚Äôs orbit
determination software, the particular orbit that the satellite occupies, the degree to which the
space weather situation is perturbed, and the span from the present time to TCA, among others.
Establishing a rubric of precedence
To reliably choose between these two information sources, CARA has performed a Verification
and Validation (V&V) activity of the orbit determination products for selected NASA O/Os and
has developed rubrics for selecting a particular solution (DOD- or O/O-based) source in
particular contexts. A V&V activity of this type requires several months‚Äô worth of data and is
complicated to perform, necessitating specialized tools and subject matter expert interpretation of
the results. With multiple providers of information for both the primary and secondary objects
involved in a conjunction, the situation would be that much more complicated.
Assimilative solution selection
An alternative to establishing a rubric of precedence for the multi-solution situation is using an
assimilative modeling approach similar to that used for hurricane modeling.
The results from multiple providers are collected and comparatively analyzed, both visually and
with formal clustering algorithms. Due to the large representation among the submissions (i.e.,
most of the individual results clustering around a single result), the hope is to be able to establish
a supermajority result that suggests itself as the favored solution. Although such a procedure
appears attractive at first, it encounters difficulties in implementation.
‚Ä¢

First, it requires a sufficient number of providers supplying solutions to obtain
meaningful data clusters. Clustering among, say, ten submitted solutions has the
propensity to identify meaningful clusters and thus enable the drawing of certain

Appendix L. Commercial Data in NASA Conjunction Assessment

119

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
conclusions. With only two or three providers, this is not really possible. At present, the
number of different providers is too small to use a clustering approach.
‚Ä¢

Second, because of explainable and therefore expected discontinuities in space
surveillance data sets, it is not unusual for minority submissions to an assimilative
framework to represent the superior solution. The common situation of satellite
maneuvers is a good example: only one of a set of providers may have detected a
maneuver for one of the spacecraft in a conjunction and updated that spacecraft‚Äôs state
appropriately. This solution is clearly superior to other submissions that did not obtain
tracking in time to identify the maneuver and correct the trajectory. But as a single
solution representing this modified state, this solution will appear assimilatively as an
outlier and is likely to be rejected. This scenario has played out repeatedly at the Sprint
Advanced Concept Training (SAC-T) exercises conducted by the U.S. Space Force‚Äôs
Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell: a single vendor‚Äôs submission differs
appreciably from the other submissions yet is shown later to be the preferred solution.

In short, while assimilative solution selection remains a potentially helpful construct for
employing multiple solutions contemporaneously to guide a single operational decision, more
research and refinement are required before such a paradigm can be employed in an
operationally satisfactory manner to support conjunction risk assessment.
Direct fusion of orbital solutions
Finally, there are proposals in the academic literature for the direct fusion of different orbital
solutions, including CDMs from different providers, into a single solution that in principle
combines the information of all the individual submissions.
Carpenter (2020) represents the most promising of such proposals, which is also nicely tailored
for the conjunction assessment problem. While the theoretical development is indisputable, a
couple of practical problems remain:
‚Ä¢

First, the combination methodology relies directly on realistic covariances accompanying
each state estimate. If these covariances are not representative, then the fused product is
errant not just in its own covariance but in its synthesized state estimate. Because
covariance realism is an elusive achievement for many providers, and because a rigorous
V&V effort is required to establish the abiding presence of realistic covariances in a
provider‚Äôs product set, direct fusion is not a mechanism that can be easily or immediately
employed.

‚Ä¢

Additionally, the theory requires the cross-correlations between the covariance matrices
arising from different providers to be characterized and deployed in the fusion paradigm,
yet there is no obvious method for establishing these cross-correlations between the
providers‚Äô orbital determination uncertainties. There is an argument that, due to the use of
different input data with different errors, the correlated error should be negligible; at the
same time, it could reasonably be expected that some shared model error, such as
geopotential error or atmospheric density forecast error, would appear in a crosscorrelation analysis.

Appendix L. Commercial Data in NASA Conjunction Assessment

120

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
So, for the direct fusion methodology described here, more focused study is needed before an
approach of this type can be employed operationally.
Conclusion about the use of commercial SSA data
Given the present difficulties with the presence of multiple SSA and conjunction assessment
products, NASA has concluded that it is necessary to limit the use of commercial SSA data to the
combination of commercial and DOD tracking information.

L.2 Validate all non-SSN data
All non-SSN sources supplying data to be used in orbit determination solutions to maintain the
catalog must be regularly calibrated to ensure the removal of any data biases that might skew the
conjunction assessment screening results.
Using raw observation data from commercial vendors (as opposed to post-processed solutions)
enables straightforward data characterization and numerical validation.
Commercial vendors supporting NASA are regularly asked to track and submit the tracking data
taken on calibration satellites for which precision ephemerides are available; these satellites can
be both dedicated calibration spheres (such as those used by the International Laser Ranging
Service) and U.S. Government payloads with stable orbits. The commercial tracking data are
compared to the precision ephemerides and the residuals characterized for each observable: mean
errors can be subtracted from the data themselves and thus do not affect the data quality, error
variances can be used as sensor data weighting factors in the orbit determination process, and
non-Gaussianity and variation of the means and variances with time can indicate an unstable
situation that may render a particular commercial provider‚Äôs data unsuitable for use.
For stable commercial data sources, quantification of mean error and error variance allows the
data to be combined with SSN data (which also have quantified error means and variances) to
produce an orbit determination result that has weighted the constituent data correctly and thus
properly considers the relative accuracy of the inputs in forming the desired single solution.

L.3 Undertake a cost/benefit analysis before purchasing commercial
SSA data
While following the recommendations of L.1 and L.2 above would allow the introduction and
proper use of commercial SSA data in NASA conjunction assessment, a third consideration
focuses on whether the use of these data would in fact result in a significant operational benefit.
NASA, as a U.S. Government entity, follows the guidance of the National Space Policy to
receive conjunction assessment services from the 18 SDS and 19 SDS, who maintain the U.S.
catalog of space objects. While it is true that adding properly calibrated commercial tracking data
should result in a more reliable orbit determination solution with a smaller uncertainty, the effect
may be such that the use of these additional data would rarely, if ever, result in a different
operational decision regarding whether to require and execute a conjunction mitigation action.

Appendix L. Commercial Data in NASA Conjunction Assessment

121

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Most conjunction situations receive adequate SSN tracking data to the degree that adding some
additional data does not change the risk assessment appreciably and therefore does not alter the
operational decisions. A complex cost-benefit analysis would need to be performed to
understand the financial obligation appropriate to purchase commercial data to augment the
existing NASA conjunction assessment process based on the risk mitigation expected.
If, for example, having commercial data changed a conjunction Pc value from 5E-05 to 1E-04,
this would cause a mitigation action to be taken when, without the data, it probably would not
have been if the Pc threshold for maneuvering were set at 1E-04, so the operational outcome was
changed to lower the risk. However, the risk exposure if the mitigation action were not taken is
still very low: an actual risk of a 1 in 10,000 chance of a collision versus the 1 in 20,000 chance
calculated with the SSN data alone.
The benefit would depend on how many times per year these decisions would be altered and thus
how much risk is mitigated. By some estimates, over 90% of the objects larger than 1cm and
thus able to render a satellite inoperative in a collision are too small to be tracked and thus are
not considered in the conjunction risk assessment process. Therefore, part of the trade space is to
consider how much adding commercial data reduces collision risk compared to the background
risk. This decision would likely vary by orbit altitude based on trackability of objects of various
sizes and the existing debris population.

Appendix M. Use of the Probability of Collision (Pc) as the
Risk Assessment Metric for Conjunction Assessment
M.1 Introduction
Satellite conjunction assessment comprises two principal goals: to protect important assets from
premature and unplanned mission failure due to preventable collisions and to assist in the
regulation and minimization of space debris production. The first of these goals is in its details
largely left up to the individual O/O to adjudicate. After all, the particular ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of any given
on-orbit asset, and therefore the level of risk of its possible loss that one is willing to bear, are
governed by the specifics of the situation including the age (and perhaps importance) of the
satellite and mission, the degree to which the mission objectives have already been met, and
mission redundancy provided by additional spacecraft. It is best left to the individual mission
project office to choose appropriate conjunction assessment actions (or inactions) relating
directly to mission preservation. However, the second goal of overall space debris production
minimization is much broader in scope. Born of the desire to keep key orbital corridors free from
debris pollution to allow their perpetual continued use by all space actors, this goal transcends
the health and preservation of the individual mission. It is in response to this second goal that
actual conjunction risk assessment and mitigation thresholds are articulated. Mission operators
can always take a more conservative posture than what is appropriate for debris mitigation, but at
the least they must embrace a minimum level of responsibility to preserve key orbital corridors
for future use.
To this end, the purpose of satellite conjunction assessment and risk analysis is neither to
maximize safety, nor fully to minimize risk of satellite conjunction with other objects, nor
absolutely eliminate the likelihood of space debris production. Instead, the official CARA
statement of purpose is more nuanced: to take prudent measures, at reasonable cost, to improve
safety of flight, without placing an undue burden on mission performance. This statement
includes a number of qualitative terms, such as ‚Äúprudent,‚Äù ‚Äúreasonable,‚Äù and ‚Äúundue burden‚Äù; for
ultimately, it is not a scientific conclusion but a series of prudential judgments to assemble
guidelines that work to prevent space debris pollution while accommodating the competing
claims of mission execution and inherent levels of risk assumed simply by launching a satellite at
all.
It is this last consideration, namely the risk necessarily assumed simply by launching a satellite,
that requires attention, especially in selecting a collision likelihood metric and evaluation
paradigm. A 2020 NASA ODPO space debris catalog generated for CARA contained over
300,000 objects larger than 1 cm in physical size, which is the level at which an object is
typically considered able to penetrate a satellite‚Äôs shielding and render it inoperative. With
tracking improvements and the launch of additional satellites, one can expect a regularly
maintained space catalog of perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 objects. This means that, roughly
speaking, about five-sixths of the objects large enough to leave a satellite in a failed and
uncontrolled state if a collision should occur with them will be untracked. Presumably, that same
proportion of the close-approach events that actually occur are not discoverable with current
sensor technology and cannot be mitigated. Given then that only about one-sixth of the closeAppendix M. Use Pc as the Risk Assessment Metric for Conjunction Assessment

approach events are trackable and in principle actionable, the overall conjunction risk analysis
process (and the risk assessment parameters that drive it) should be commensurate with a
situation in which greater than 85% of similarly likely collisions cannot be addressed at all and
thus constitute a risk that simply has to be accepted. It is not reasonable to adopt an excessively
conservative risk management position for known conjunctions when so substantial a portion of
the actual collision risk is accepted without any possible mitigation as part of the cost of space
operations.
However, despite the large background collision likelihood that is accepted simply by launching
a satellite at all, there is still great value to on-orbit conjunction analysis, risk assessment, and
mitigation. First, because collisions between protected payloads and large secondary objects will
produce, by several orders of magnitude, the most debris fragments, there is substantial benefit to
avoiding collisions of this type. These large secondary objects are resident and well maintained
in the present satellite catalog, so they represent rather straightforward cases for conjunction
assessment. Second, when serious conjunctions of any type are identified and are well
understood, these also represent straightforward situations for which due diligence counsels risk
assessment and possible mitigation action. It is only when the situation is poorly determined‚Äî
when some information about a conjunction is present but not of the sufficiency needed to
conclude that a problematic situation is in fact at hand‚Äîthat requiring remediation actions
through an overweening conservatism is not appropriate, given the size of the accepted
background risk.
The purpose of this appendix is to explain the selected risk assessment metric and interpretive
framework for that metric, chosen to enable proper balance between mitigation of truly
problematic conjunctions and an unnecessary conservatism that reduces spacecraft lifetime and
unduly encumbers science mission objectives.

M.2 Point of Reference: Conjunction Risk Assessment Based on Miss
Distance
In the early days of conjunction assessment, satellite position uncertainty data were not regularly
available, so the only orbital data product on which to base conjunction risk mitigation decisions
was the predicted miss distance at TCA between the two conjuncting satellites. If the miss
distances were smaller than the combined sizes of the two objects (a quantity usually on the
order of 10-20 meters), then it was clear that a mitigation action would be necessary to modify
the primary satellite‚Äôs orbit to increase this miss distance to a safe level. But it was also known
that there was often significant uncertainty in the two objects‚Äô predicted state estimates, so miss
distances that were larger than the objects‚Äô combined size were also likely to be threatening‚Äîbut
how threatening, precisely? Similarly, if a mitigation action such as a maneuver were pursued,
how large should such an action be to guarantee a desirable level of safety? Because the answers
to these questions were not known, very conservative miss-distance thresholds were then
embraced, often based on very little analysis, which led to a great deal of operational anxiety and
unnecessary mitigation actions. For example, nearly all conjunctions with miss distances (at
TCA) less than a value of 5 km present perfectly safe encounters, but all of these could be treated
as worrisome and worthy of potential mitigation actions. Such a situation could not be sustained
operationally: it went beyond prudence and presented an undue burden to mission operations.

Best Practices Handbook
Methods were thus developed that considered the characterized error in the state estimates to
determine the likelihood that the two trajectories at TCA would have a close approach smaller
than the combined sizes of the two satellites.
Approaches that view the problem in this way, namely those that give an actual likelihood that
the miss distance will be small enough to cause a collision, are certainly an advance over the use
of the miss distance alone. It is important to remember, however, that the probabilistic answer
they produce is solely a function of the quality of the astrodynamics data that are used as input to
the computation‚Äîthe tracking information available and the errors encountered in predicting
states from epoch to TCA. In truth, the probability of collision for any given conjunction is
actually either 1 or 0: the conjunction is either going to result in a collision, or it is not. The
probabilistic framing comes from the degree of predictive certainty of the outcome brought by
the quality of the astrodynamics data in the particular case. There is no ‚Äúdefinitive‚Äù collision
likelihood value for a particular conjunction. Improvements in data and data quality will push the
calculated answer further toward the values of 0 or 1 depending on whether the two satellites
actually are on path to collide, and because satellite collisions are extremely rare events, in
nearly every case the true likelihood of collision is 0. Sometimes interest is expressed in wishing
to obtain sufficient tracking data to allow the ‚Äútrue‚Äù collision likelihood to be calculated, or after
the event, to rework the solution using the tracking data collected ex post facto to establish what
the ‚Äúdefinitive‚Äù collision likelihood actually was. None of these considerations is in the end
helpful, or for that matter even possible. In the first case, while more and better data will provide
a superior answer, any value short of 0 or 1 is just an estimate constrained ultimately by the
inadequacy of the tracking data. In the second case, the ex post facto solution is not definitive but
is yet another estimate, this time with somewhat better input data. The probabilistic framework is
helpful and desirable, but in the end, it reflects what is known about the conjunction situation
rather than being a stand-alone, absolute assessment of collision likelihood.

M.3 Use of Pc for Conjunction Risk Assessment Requirements
Many conjunction risk assessment metrics that have been proposed in the critical literature;
Hejduk and Snow (2019) give a useful overview, description, and attempted categorization. In
choosing a particular collision likelihood metric for requirements specification purposes,
different considerations, technical and otherwise, are relevant:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Suitability to NASA‚Äôs risk posture regarding conjunction risk assessment;
Ability to represent the collision likelihood in a manner commensurate with this risk
posture;
Straightforwardness and tractability of calculation;
Ease of conceptual grasp of the metric and its origins; and
Acceptance within the conjunction assessment industry.

From these considerations, CARA has chosen the Probability of Collision (Pc) as the metric for
high-risk conjunction identification. Of the different options examined, this metric was the best
candidate to evaluate collision risk given the desired context of balancing safety of flight with
minimizing the disruption of mission objectives. It is straightforward to calculate and, with
certain recent improvements, can be computed quite accurately in many astrodynamically
Appendix M. Use Pc as the Risk Assessment Metric for Conjunction Assessment

125

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

demanding circumstances. It can be explained relatively easily to, and be interpreted by, decision
makers. It can be turned into a statement about miss distances if this framework is desired.
Finally, it is the emerging metric of choice among the military, civil, and commercial
conjunction assessment industries.
The Pc metric, as calculated by analytic methods, was first explained formally in 1992 (Foster
and Estes). A comprehensive treatment of the calculation and associated issues can be found in
Chan (2008), although this monograph is now somewhat dated and does not consider many of
the newer collision likelihood calculation proposals. (See Appendix K for an explanation of the
presently embraced calculation methods for this parameter, along with the tests that have to be
performed to determine which calculation approach to use in any particular case. It may be
helpful to the reader new to conjunction assessment to refer to Appendix K before proceeding as
it gives a precise definition of terms used in the following treatment.)

M.4 Pc and Probability Dilution
Despite the previous section‚Äôs account of selecting a metric, the Pc is not a parameter without
controversy. The main objection to the metric is a phenomenon called ‚Äúprobability dilution‚Äù in
which low values of the Pc do not necessarily guarantee safety although they can offer support
for refraining from a mitigation action. This section discusses the overall phenomenon of
probability dilution and explains why it is viewed as a manageable issue when using the Pc in
mitigation threshold development.
As stated previously, probabilistic conjunction assessment metrics take on their probabilistic
nature from the uncertainties in the state estimation data used to characterize the miss distance at
TCA. It is not difficult to understand the alignment of inputs that creates a high Pc value: the
calculated miss distance between the two objects is small, and the primary and secondary object
covariances (and thus the uncertainty on the miss distance) are reasonably small also, so one
easily envisions that of the entire set of possible actual miss distances, some notable portion will
be smaller than the hard-body radius. The Pc, which is the portion of the possible miss distances
smaller than the hard-body radius, will be relatively large. Imagine a similar situation for a small
Pc: the nominal miss distance is large, and the covariances and miss-distance uncertainty are
small, so the range of possible actual miss distances are nearly all rather large. One can conclude
quite satisfactorily in such a case that there is little chance that the actual miss distance will be
less than the hard-body radius.
But what if, for either of the previous cases, one or both covariances are extremely large? This
would happen if, for at least one of the satellites, the predicted position at TCA, due either to a
poor orbit determination update or difficulties in accurate propagation, were extremely badly
known. The predicted miss distance is by definition the expected value, but it is a poor proximate
prediction of the miss distance because there is so much uncertainty in one or both of the
satellites‚Äô position at TCA. The range of possible miss distances now becomes extremely large.
Therefore, a relatively smaller portion of the possible miss-distance values will be smaller than
the hard-body radius, and the Pc will take on a small value. In the earlier case in which the
nominal miss distance was large but the covariances small, one could with confidence conclude,
based on the quality of the data, that a collision is unlikely. In this latter case, the likelihood of
Appendix M. Use Pc as the Risk Assessment Metric for Conjunction Assessment

126

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
collision is also small, but only because one has very little idea where one or both satellites
actually will be at TCA, so one cannot conclude that a small miss distance is likely when so large
a range of miss distances is possible. This latter case is called ‚Äúprobability dilution‚Äù (a term
introduced by the first treatment of this subject in the literature (Alfano 2005b)) because the
small value of the Pc is not achieved by the certainty of well-established state estimates but
through ‚Äúdilution‚Äù by relatively poor state estimates.
An analogy that is sometimes helpful is that of determining whether two cars parked in a large
parking lot are parked next to each other. If one knew that one car was parked on the left side of
the parking lot and the other on the right side of the parking lot, then one could conclude that it is
unlikely that the two cars are parked next to each other: only if both cars park on the boundary
between the left and right sides, and then only if they actually choose adjacent spaces, will the
two cars be parked next to each other. This is a conclusion enabled by the definiteness of the
data. Now, suppose that one knows nothing at all about where the two cars are parked in the
parking lot; what is the likelihood of their being parked next to each other? It is also low, but in
this case not because one knows that the cars have been placed in different parts of the lot but
rather because, in a large parking lot, it is simply unlikely that any two cars will happen to be
next to each other. It is a conclusion that follows not from what is known but rather from what is
not known; one cannot conclude from the available data that the cars are probably far apart; but
at the same time there is no evidence to indicate that they are close. If, therefore, one is required
to hazard a guess, the large size of the parking lot makes the supposition that they are not
adjacent reasonable.
So, what is the risk assessor to do in such a situation? One could embrace a very conservative
position and require that, unless it can be demonstrated conclusively that the two satellites are
virtually certain not to collide, a mitigation action is warranted. Some commentators have
suggested this position as the natural one for advancing safety of flight (e.g., Balch et al. 2019).
There are two sets of difficulties with such a position, one of which is practical and the other
conceptual.
The practical difficulty centers on the number of increased mitigation actions and the magnitude
of those actions if an extremely conservative risk analysis metric/approach were to be embraced
operationally. An analysis by Hejduk et al. (2019) indicated that, for a protected asset in a 700
km circular orbit, the adoption of the conservative ‚Äúellipse overlap‚Äù technique, for which the two
covariances‚Äô overlap has to be limited to a very small value to certify that a collision is extremely
unlikely, would increase the number of mitigation actions by a factor of anywhere from 6 to 10.
Most O/Os believe they are already assuming a relatively safe posture in that they have set the
thresholds on the risk-assessment metrics they currently use to require mitigation actions close to
the mitigation action rate that they believe they can sustain without unacceptable mission
disruption. While perhaps a relatively bounded increase could be countenanced, any expansion
beyond that would be extremely difficult to accept. Increases by a factor of as much as an order
of magnitude simply cannot be borne without resulting in major disruption, if not nullification, of
the mission activities that most satellites are launched to perform. Furthermore, remediation
actions based on minimizing covariance ellipsoid overlap rather than reducing the Pc value to an
acceptable level will need to be large‚Äîmuch larger than the typical satellite maneuvers that are
Appendix M. Use Pc as the Risk Assessment Metric for Conjunction Assessment

127

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

presently performed. Large maneuvers expend additional fuel and, if pursued more frequently,
will also require subsequent response maneuvers to restore the orbital parameters that were
violated by the initial mitigation action. An extremely conservative risk analysis approach such
as the one described here is simply not seen as operationally viable for most missions.
In addition to these practical impediments, a conceptual dissonance is introduced in embracing
an extremely conservative risk-assessment strategy given the much larger collision background
risk from untracked/uncataloged objects. As previously explained, the dynamics of the dilution
region result in a reduction in severity and therefore a reduction in perceived necessity to act as
less is known about the conjunction. As the amount of tracking information (or, similarly, the
amount of certainty in prediction) for a dilution-region conjunction is worsened, the satellite
covariance(s) increase in size, and the Pc decreases until ultimately it results in a value of 0 (to
machine precision). This asymptotic value of nullity aligns nicely with the zero-value Pc that is,
at least indirectly, imputed to conjunctions with untracked/uncataloged objects and about which
the risk-assessment analyst can do nothing at all. As one progresses from knowing a lot, to a
little, to nothing at all about a conjunction, the Pc moves conceptually from a higher value, to a
lower value, to a zero value. For an extremely conservative approach such as that of minimizing
covariance ellipsoid overlap, an opposing and inconsistent dynamic is observed: the less one
knows about the conjunction, the larger the covariance ellipsoids are, and therefore larger and
more frequent maneuvers are required to achieve minimum ellipsoid overlap to ensure safety
until one moves from knowing a small amount about a conjunction to knowing nothing at all,
and then‚Äîthere is a sudden disjunction from taking large and invasive actions to doing nothing.
Given that, as stated previously, about 85% of the conjunctions that a satellite actually faces
cannot be addressed at all because nothing is known about them, it does not make sense that, for
the small number of conjunctions for which only poor data are available, large and disruptive
mitigations are required.
Instead, the use of the Pc, with the dilution region dynamic explicitly recognized, is a more
natural fit for the situation that is actually encountered. When outside the dilution region, a
satisfactory amount of orbital data and reasonably small covariances exist. In this situation, the
Pc accurately reflects a situation that is either worrisome or safe, and one can be confident in the
conclusion in either case. If in the dilution region the Pc is high despite the poor data quality and
large covariances, a worrisome situation has very much been identified, so appropriate mitigation
action should be taken. If in the dilution region the Pc is low, one cannot, as has been explained
previously, necessarily infer that the situation is safe; the two satellites might actually be poised
for a dangerous close approach with this fact obscured by poor data quality‚Äîa situation that
could potentially be revealed by the summoning of additional tracking data. It is appropriate to
recognize that this situation (state estimate with large covariance) is not dissimilar to that of a
conjunction with an untracked/uncataloged object about which nothing is known (random state
estimate and infinite covariance). It is thus acceptable to treat low-Pc dilution region cases as a
small extension of the untracked/uncataloged object conjunctions and not pursue a mitigation
action. Requiring conjunction remediation for low-Pc cases with poor data quality when such
cases are truly very similar to the ~85% of conjunctions that are believed to exist but for which
no mitigation is possible is not considered to be a prudent measure and thus runs counter to the
CARA statement of purpose.
Appendix M. Use Pc as the Risk Assessment Metric for Conjunction Assessment

128

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
While not appropriate for broad implementation, conservative approaches such as ellipsoid
overlap minimization are not without merit. In situations in which the collision risk may be
pushed higher by other factors, such as a high-consequence conjunction due to the potential to
produce large amounts of debris, it may be desirable to employ a conservative method when in
the dilution region. In such a case, one might first analyze the situation by manipulating the
covariance and determining the highest Pc value that could be realized with the miss distance
(following Alfano 2005b); if that Pc is still below the threshold, then the conservative approach
would be difficult to justify. But if this ‚Äúmaximum Pc‚Äù is above the threshold, then the
conjunction could in fact be worrisome, and a conservative approach could be properly applied.
At a minimum, if it were possible to marshal additional tracking data to improve the state
estimate, then a situation such as this would be a good fit for employing such a capability.
Finally, it should be noted that there have been interesting proposals recently for risk assessment
approaches based not on the probability of collision but on the (somewhat) related concept of
examining confidence intervals on the miss distance; such proposals include those of Carpenter
(2019) and Elkantassi and Davison (2022). These approaches, which are presently being
evaluated formally, bring the advantage of avoiding situations in which, with relatively small
miss distances, even risky conjunctions might be obscured by the inability, due to largish
covariances, to integrate up enough risk to register as problematic events that require mitigation.
However, the expectation is that using such approaches will produce unacceptably large false
alarm rates, and the issue of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù high-risk events in low-miss-distance situations can be
addressed by adding a miss distance mitigation criterion in addition to that based on the Pc. But
any firm recommendations will need to wait for the completion of a full analysis.

M.5 Conclusion
It is emphasized that the above guidance describes and explains why Pc was chosen by NASA
CARA as the risk-assessment metric to be used to determine the circumstances under which a
mitigation action is required of missions to promote preservation of orbital corridors from debris
pollution. O/Os may always pursue additional mitigation actions in a manner that increases the
conservatism of their safety profile. For the case of low-Pc conjunctions in the dilution region,
missions may elect to pursue mitigation actions. They may even use extremely conservative
methods such as ellipsoid overlap minimization to size these mitigation actions. This guidance
indicates that mitigation actions are required only when the Pc exceeds the appropriate
mitigation threshold. Missions may always pursue additional such actions, either episodically or
as part of a standing strategy, if they wish a more risk-adverse safety posture.

Appendix N. Pc Calculation Approaches
N.1 Introduction
This appendix discusses the selection of the Probability of Collision (Pc) as the risk assessment
parameter to use for conjunction assessment requirements compliance. While this parameter is
widely used in the conjunction assessment industry, issues related to its calculation exist that
merit extended discussion. The most frequently used analytical techniques to calculate the Pc are
well established and computationally efficient but include assumptions that restrict their use and
make the calculations vulnerable to error for a small fraction of conjunctions. Numerical
techniques also exist, such as Monte Carlo Pc estimation. Predictably, these make fewer
assumptions and are more widely applicable, but they are much more computationally
demanding. There are also issues related to the regularization and interpretation of the input data
to the Pc calculation, some of which are resolved by techniques that are now becoming standard
practices. In calculating Pc estimates, it is necessary to examine and prepare the input datasets
carefully and then to choose the calculation approach that is appropriate to the situation. The
purpose of this appendix is to amplify the Pc calculation-related recommendations by providing
an extended technical explanation of the data preparation and Pc calculation issues so that
implementers and users of these calculations can proceed with a better understanding of the
different options and resultant fidelities of Pc calculation.
To accomplish this goal, this appendix will address the following technical areas:
‚Ä¢

A step-by-step description of the conjunction plane two-dimensional Pc calculation,
which is the most established and widely used analytical Pc computation technique, and
its enabling simplifications and assumptions;

‚Ä¢

Examination and repair/expansion of input data to the calculation, focusing mostly on the
orbital state covariance matrices for the two objects in conjunction;

‚Ä¢

Discussion of the use of Monte Carlo techniques, which is the numerical method used for
high-fidelity Pc computation;

‚Ä¢

A test to determine whether an analytical or numerical technique should be used for a
particular conjunction;

‚Ä¢

Approaches to choosing for the Pc calculation the hard-body radius, which gives a
statement of the combined sizes of the primary and secondary objects; and

‚Ä¢

Discussion of alternative analytic Pc calculation methods, specifically the two- and threedimensional ‚ÄúNc‚Äù (as opposed to ‚ÄúPc‚Äù) estimation methods that address conjunctions
affected by curvilinear trajectories and non-Gaussian distribution effects.

N.2 Conjunction Plane Analytic Pc Calculation
The conjunction plane method of Pc calculation, which is by far the most widely used approach
in the conjunction assessment industry, was developed for the Space Shuttle Program and first
described in the literature in 1992 (Foster and Estes). There have been a number of important
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

130

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
treatments since that time ‚éØ e.g., Akella and Alfriend (2000), Patera (2001), Alfano (2005a),
Chan (2008), Garcia-Pelayo (2016), and Elrod (2019) ‚éØ but all rely on the same basic
methodology: applying reasonable assumptions to enable analytical approximations. While the
particulars vary, these approaches all share the same concept of calculating the Pc estimate by
integrating over a two-dimensional region on a conjunction encounter plane.
Conjunction plane Pc analysis begins with the states and covariances for the primary and
secondary objects‚Äô orbital states at TCA. An important set of questions should be addressed
concerning whether these data, especially the covariances, are truly representative of the
expected states and uncertainties at TCA or whether the propagation process has distorted them.
These questions will be addressed in a subsequent section, once a more focused context for them
has been established through the present discussion of the general procedure.
The first step is to recognize that Pc calculations depend on the relative positions and
uncertainties of the two objects, so moving to a framework that views the problem this way is
helpful. Subtraction of the two objects‚Äô positions produces a relative position vector, the
magnitude of which is the miss distance between the two objects (at TCA). Similarly, because
interest is in the relative rather than absolute position uncertainty, it is possible to combine the
two objects‚Äô covariances to form a joint (relative) covariance and allocate that, if desired, to one
‚Äúend‚Äù of the relative position vector (by convention the end for the secondary object), as shown
in Figure N-1. There are, of course, questions regarding whether the two covariances are
independent and can be combined by simple addition; this question is addressed in a later
section, but it is typically acceptable to presume independence and combine the covariances in
this manner.

Figure N-1 Relative Positions and Uncertainties of Two Objects
The second step relates to modeling the combined sizes of the primary and secondary objects.
The general approach is to place a circumscribing sphere about the primary (whose size is well
known by the O/O because it is their satellite) and then do the same thing for the secondary but
often via an estimation technique as the secondary is usually a debris object for which there is no
definitive size information. If these two spheres approach and begin to overlap one another at
any point during the encounter, then a potential collision has been identified. Again, keeping in
mind that a relative framework is useful here, the two objects‚Äô size spheres can be combined into
one super-sphere (also called the ‚Äúcollision sphere‚Äù) and placed at one end, by convention the
primary object end, of the relative miss vector, as shown in Figure N-2. If the miss vector should
shrink to be smaller than the radius of the collision sphere (also called the hard-body radius), that
would be the equivalent of the two original spheres encroaching on each other at TCA.
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

131

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

Figure N-2 Combining the Sizes of the Primary and Secondary Objects
The third step is to envision the situation at TCA in which all the uncertainty is assigned to the
secondary object‚Äôs end of the relative miss vector held in a fixed position in the mind. The
primary object end of the relative miss vector is moving along through TCA and bringing with it
the sphere representing both objects‚Äô combined size. Even though the satellites follow curved
trajectories and the covariance evolves and changes at each instant, if the encounter is presumed
to take place extremely quickly‚Äîand this is in most conjunctions a good assumption because the
satellites‚Äô relative velocity usually exceeds 10 km/sec‚Äîthen two assumptions can be made: the
trajectories are essentially rectilinear during the encounter period, and the covariances (and thus
the joint covariance) can be considered static. This means that the encounter can be envisioned as
in Figure N-3:

Figure N-3 Geometry at TCA
The passing of the primary object by the secondary can be seen as following a ‚Äúsoda straw‚Äù
straight trajectory whose cylindrical radius is the same as that for the hard-body radius and
whose placement is one miss distance away from the position of the secondary at TCA. Since the
joint covariance shown as the ellipsoid above represents the uncertainty of one ‚Äúend‚Äù of the
miss-distance vector (as shown by the central dot in the above diagram), this dot can be
presumed to be potentially in any place within the ellipsoid, meaning that in some portion of
those realizations, it will fall within the soda straw. When this is the case, a collision is
presumed. The task is to determine the likelihood that the dot will, in the actual realization of this
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

132

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
conjunction, fall within the cylindrical path (‚Äúsoda straw‚Äù) swept out by the motion of the
primary object. This probability can be decomposed to be rendered as the product of the
individual probabilities that each component of the secondary object position (the dot) will fall
within the soda straw pathway, i.e., if an orthogonal x-y-z coordinate system is presumed, this
overall probability can be generated as the product of the probability that the x-component of the
dot‚Äôs position will fall within the straw, the y-component of the dot‚Äôs position will fall within the
straw, and the z-component of the dot‚Äôs position will fall within the straw. If this coordinate
system is aligned so that one of the axes (e.g., the z axis) aligns with the direction of the straw,
because one is assuming rectilinear motion, the soda straw can be presumed to be unbending and
infinite in length, and as such, it will contain all of the z-component probability of the dot‚Äôs
falling within the straw. As such, the z-component probability in this arrangement will be unity
and will be what is called ‚Äúmarginalized out,‚Äù meaning that the overall probability can be fully
represented by the probability remaining with the x- and y-components. The entire situation can
thus be reduced from three to two dimensions and analyzed as a phenomenon that occurs on a
plane that is orthogonal to the soda-straw direction, which is the direction of the relative velocity
vector. This procedure defines the ‚Äúconjunction plane,‚Äù which can be viewed in two equivalent
representations as discussed by Chan (2008, see Figure 5.1), and as shown in Figure N-4.

Figure N-4 Two Equivalent Representations of the Conjunction Plane
In the first representation, shown in the left panel of Figure N-4, the center of the secondary
object is placed at the origin, and the local (x, y) coordinate system configured so that the miss
vector (which extends a distance of rmiss from the secondary to the primary object) lies along the
horizontal x axis. The ‚Äúsoda straw‚Äù is coming out of the page and represented as the hard-bodyradius circle. With this planar reduction, the Pc is now the frequency with which the missdistance vector will fall within the hard-body-radius circle; this is equivalent to the amount of
joint covariance probability density (illustrated here using a 1ÔÅ≥ ellipse) falling within that circle.
Since the projected joint covariance represents a bivariate Gaussian distribution, the amount of
its probability density falling within the hard-body-radius circle is given by the following twodimensional integral (Foster and Estes, 1992)

in which r is the 2ÔÇ¥1 miss vector, C is the 2ÔÇ¥2 covariance matrix, and A is the hard-body-radius
circular area. There are several different approaches to evaluating this integral. Foster and Estes
(1992) applied a two-dimensional quadrature technique; this works well, and MATLAB¬Æ‚Äôs13
adaptive quad2d integrator is quite equal to the task, although perhaps not the most
computationally efficient of all possible choices. Chan (2008) uses equivalent-area transforms to
produce a single-dimensional integral, which has a series solution. Garcia-Pelayo et al. (2016)
also derives a multi-term series approximation. However, even though these series
approximations are relatively computationally efficient, experience indicates that they
occasionally produce inaccuracies. Elrod (2019) formulates the integral in terms of
complementary error functions (to improve accuracy for conjunctions with small Pc values) and
uses Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature with nodal symmetry (which improves the efficiency of the
numerical integration considerably). The Foster and Elrod approaches (the former being the
established standard, and the latter being extremely fast, especially with a vectorized MATLAB
implementation) are included as the Pc2D_Foster and PcElrod functions in the Pc Computation
Software Development Kit (SDK) in the NASA CARA software repository. (See Section 7,
Contact Information in this document for the specific URL.)
In the second conjunction plane representation, shown in the right panel of Figure N-4, the
secondary object location again is placed at the origin, but in this case the local (xÔÇ¢, yÔÇ¢) coordinate
system is configured so that the principal axis of the covariance ellipse lies along the horizontal
axis. The center of the primary object lies at (xmiss, ymiss), and the axes are oriented so that this
miss position lies within the 1st quadrant, so that xmiss ‚â• 0 and ymiss ‚â• 0. Using this representation,
the Pc is given by a one-dimensional integral involving error functions (Alfano, 2005a)

difference of two error functions, ‚àÜ = ‚àíerf(ùë¶‚àí ). In many software environments (e.g.,
MATLAB), this factor often can be computed significantly more accurately as a difference of
complementary error functions, i.e., ‚àÜ = erfc(ùë¶‚àí ) ‚àí erfc(ùë¶+ ), especially when calculating very
small Pc values (Elrod, 2019). See Abramowitz and Stegun (1970) and Press et al. (1992) for
details on computing erf(-) and erfc(-) functions.
For most conjunctions, Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature provides an efficient and accurate means to
calculate the one-dimensional integral in equation (N-2), using an approach similar to that
described by Elrod (2019). However, for conjunctions involving relatively large hard-body radii
(or, equivalently, small covariance ellipse ùúéùë• dimensions), this method can potentially become
inaccurate. Specifically, Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature becomes increasingly inaccurate as the
hard-body radius grows beyond the limit ùëÖùëôùëñùëö = 4ùúéùë• ‚àí min(ùëÖ). In such cases, which rarely
occur in practice, an adaptive numerical integrator can be used to calculate an accurate estimate,
e.g., MATLAB‚Äôs integral function. (The function PcConjPlaneCircle of the NASA CARA SDK

repository implements a vectorized algorithm that automatically determines which of these two
integration methods should be used to compute Pc values accurately for all input hard-body radii
and covariance values, with a computation speed comparable to that of the PcElrod function for
most conjunctions. Also, for cases that have hard-body radii well below the limit given above,
testing indicates that the SDK functions Pc_Foster, PcElrod, and PcConjPlaneCircle all output
nearly identical numerical Pc values, i.e., that typically agree to five digits of precision or more.)
The second conjunction plane representation shown in the right panel of Figure N-4 also
provides an extremely efficient means to calculate an upper limit estimate for the Pc value. This
upper bound corresponds to the two-dimensional (2-D) integral over the square that
circumscribes the hard-body radius circle (as shown in Figure N-4), which has the following
analytical solution

(N-4)

Again, in many cases the erf(-) differences in equation (N-3) can be computed more accurately
using erfc(-) differences. Notably, the circumscribing square probability estimate does not
require any numerical integration at all, but instead only requires the computation of four erf(-)
or erfc(-) functions, usually making it relatively easy to program into software and significantly
more computationally efficient. These considerations could be important in some circumstances
(e.g., for computations performed on orbiting satellites), prompting the use of ùëÉùë†ùëû as an
approximation for ùëÉùëê itself. For instance, CDMs generated by the USSPACECOM ASW
processing system often reports ùëÉùë†ùëû as the estimate of conjunction‚Äôs collision probability. (An
optional, non-default mode of the function PcConjPlaneCircle in the NASA CARA SDK
repository implements an efficient vectorized algorithm that calculates ùëÉùë†ùëû values).
It is perhaps helpful at this point to review the four assumptions employed by the conjunction
plane Pc calculation methods given by equations (N-1) through (N-4), because alternative Pc
estimation techniques will be needed when these assumptions do not inhere:
1. Statistical Independence: The two objects‚Äô uncertainty distributions are statistically
independent so that the joint covariance can be obtained by simple addition of the two
covariances. This assumption is largely true but can break down for objects that share global
atmospheric density forecast error in a manner that influences the conjunction. This issue will
be discussed as an isolated topic in a subsequent section of this appendix.
2. Rectilinear Motion: The conjunction circumstances are such that it is reasonable to presume
rectilinear motion and static covariances during the encounter. These conditions inhere for
most conjunctions between Earth-orbiting satellites. The objects‚Äô relative velocity at TCA is
in some places used as an indication of the reasonability of these assumptions, but this

135

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
parameter alone is not sufficient to identify situations in which the conjunction plane Pc
approximation will miscarry.
3. Gaussian Position Distributions and Negligible Velocity Uncertainties: The position vector
state errors for each satellite at TCA follow Gaussian distributions, and the velocity vector
state errors are negligibly small. When combined, these assumptions lead to the conjunction
plane representations shown in Figure N-4. Conjunctions that do not satisfy these
assumptions are addressed by alternate analytical and Monte Carlo methods, discussed in the
sections below.
4. Temporally Isolated Event: The conjunction presents a single, well-defined event so that the
collision likelihood can be ascertained by examining that single instance. Objects that stay in
close proximity for extended periods accumulate risk throughout long interactions, rather
than quickly accumulating risk at or near a well-defined TCA. A different approach is also
required for their evaluation, which is discussed in the sections below.
As mentioned previously, the issue of statistical independence (i.e., assumption 1 above) will be
discussed in a subsequent section of this appendix. To address conjunctions that do not satisfy
any of the other assumptions, two alternative (but more computationally intensive) analytical
methods are available: the ‚Äúthree-dimensional Nc‚Äù method, which research indicates can be
applied to conjunctions that violate assumptions 2, 3 and/or 4 above, and the ‚Äútwo-dimensional
Nc‚Äù method, applicable to temporally isolated conjunctions that violate assumptions 2 and/or 3.
Notably, the three-dimensional Nc method could, in principal, be applied to all conjunctions to
estimate Pc values. However, this is not justified because most LEO satellite conjunction Pc
values can be estimated accurately using the much more efficient conjunction plane methods
described above. Additionally, most of the remaining conjunctions can be estimated accurately
using the two-dimensional Nc method, which, although much slower than the conjunction plane
methods, is still significantly faster than the full three-dimensional Nc method. (The function
PcConjPlaneUsageViolation soon to be posted on the NASA CARA Software Development Kit
(SDK) repository provides an algorithm that determines if a given conjunction violates one or
more of conjunction plane Pc estimation assumptions, and if so, which of the other available Pc
estimation methods are appropriate.)

N.3 Three-Dimensional Nc Method Analytic Pc Calculations
The relatively infrequent conjunctions that do not satisfy the conjunction plane method
assumptions discussed in the previous section must be addressed with a different methodology,
and in response to this need, several authors have formulated semi-analytical approaches
relaxing some or all of these assumptions. Coppola (2012) proposed a method for single
encounters designed to account for non-linear orbital motion and velocity uncertainties, resulting
in an approximation for the probability rate, ùëÉùëêÃá (ùë°), calculated using integration over the surface
of a unit sphere. When combined with a one-dimensional time integration, this yields a ‚Äúthreedimensional Pc‚Äù approximation. Chan (2015) contested Coppola‚Äôs formulation, arguing that a
proper approach must employ a set of random variables associated with a time-invariant
Probability Density Function (PDF). NASA CARA implemented the three-dimensional Pc
method in software (Hall et al. 2017a) and subsequently discovered that, for some conjunctions,
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

136

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

it can produce ùëÉùëê estimates that differ significantly from high-fidelity Monte Carlo Pc
calculations, even though all the required three-dimensional Pc assumptions are satisfied.
Shelton and Junkins (2019) provided a key insight into why the original three-dimensional Pc
approximation fails in certain situations. Their analysis indicates that accurate Pc approximations
require that the state uncertainty PDFs of the two satellites be estimated accurately in the volume
of space where they overlap the most. The original Coppola (2012) three-dimensional Pc
formulation did not incorporate this concept, but Hall (2021) reformulated the method to do so
explicitly. For single encounters, the reformulated approach approximates the curvilinear motion
of each satellite using a first-order Taylor series expansion, not centered on the mean orbital
state, but centered instead on a state that coincides with the maximum overlap of the PDFs for
the two satellites. The analysis demonstrates that such ‚Äúpeak overlap‚Äù states can be determined
using an iterative calculation that converges quickly. The formulation derives an expression for
‚ÄúNc‚Äù ‚éØ the statistically expected number of collisions ‚éØ which equals Pc for single, temporally
isolated conjunctions, but that may exceed Pc for multi-encounter interactions. The resulting
‚Äúthree-dimensional Nc‚Äù method entails a total of three numerical integrations, one over time and
two over the surface of a sphere. The outermost, time integration expression has the form
ùúèùëè

ùëÅùëê (ùúèùëé , ùúèùëè ) = ‚à´ ùëÅÃáùëê (ùë°) ùëëùë°

(N-5)

ùúèùëé

This expression estimates ùëÅùëê (ùúèùëé , ùúèùëè ), the number of collisions statistically expected to occur at
some time during the risk assessment interval ùúèùëé ‚â§ ùë° < ùúèùëè , which can represent either a short
duration closely bracketing a single close-approach encounter, or an extended duration spanning
multiple encounters. The expected collision number is closely related to the collision probability.
In fact, they are equal for single, isolated encounters between well-tracked satellites. The
collision rate for such a temporally isolated conjunction is expressed as a two-dimensional
integral over the unit sphere

In this equation, the radial unit vector is given by ùíìÃÇ = [cos(ùúë) sin(ùúÉ), sin(ùúë) sin(ùúÉ), cos(ùúÉ)]ùëá ,
so the surface of the unit sphere is spanned by the azimuthal angle 0 ‚â§ ùúë < 2ùúã and the axial
angle 0 ‚â§ ùúÉ ‚â§ ùúã. The leading factor of ùëÖ 2 represents the square of the combined hard-body
radius, meaning that the expression actually represents an integration over the surface area of the
collision sphere. As explained in Hall (2021), the integrand function in the square brackets is the
product of two factors. The first in an average velocity term, ùúàùë° (ùíìÃÇ), which is a function of time
(as indicated by the t subscript) and calculated using the TCA states and covariances of the
ÃÉ ùë° ), represents a multi-variate
primary and secondary objects. The second factor, ùëÄùëâùëÅ(ùëÖùíìÃÇ, ùíìÃÜùë° , ùë®

ÃÉ ùë° covariance matrix, both of which are also calculated
state vector, ùíìÃÜùë° , and an associated 3ÔÇ¥3 ùë®
from the TCA states and covariances. Lebedev quadrature (Lebedev and Laikov, 1999) provides
an efficient method for numerical integration over the unit sphere. (The function Pc3D_Hall of

the NASA CARA SDK repository computes conjunction Pc estimates, along with associated Nc
and Nc rate estimates, using the Hall (2021) three-dimensional Nc method as summarized in
equations (N-5) and (N-6) above.)

Figure N-5 Pc Rate and Cumulative Pc for a Non-Rectilinear Conjunction
Figure N-5 shows the time-dependent collision rate (left) and the cumulative Pc (right)
calculated using the three-dimensional Nc method, as applied to an archived CARA conjunction
that has a high relative velocity (~13 km/s), but that fails to satisfy the rectilinear motion and
Gaussian PDF assumptions. This specific event does not satisfy these assumptions because it
involves an object in a highly eccentric orbit with a conjunction occurring in the relatively tightly
curved part of the trajectory near perigee, a phenomenology discussed by Hall (2018). In this
case, the three-dimensional Nc method calculates a Pc value which accurately matches the
Monte Carlo from TCA method Pc estimate, but that is a factor of fifteen larger than the
erroneous conjunction plane Pc estimate, calculated in this case using the two-dimensional
Foster and Estes (1992) method. It is of interest that the peak point of risk accumulation occurs
nine seconds before the TCA, with essentially all the risk accumulated by 8 seconds before TCA.
Such a result can seem counterintuitive at first, for one would initially expect that the point of
highest risk would always be at the TCA. However, what is operative is the alignment between
the geometric miss distance and the covariance. If at TCA very little of the position uncertainty
lies along the relative miss vector, then that miss vector is a strong statement of the actual miss;
and if the vector is somewhat larger than the hard-body radius (HBR), then the collision risk at
that point is quite low. If, however, somewhat earlier or later than TCA the combined covariance
(which, it must be remembered, is constantly changing position) does more substantially align
along the miss vector, then more possible instantiations of the true miss are likely to be smaller
than the HBR (even with the nominal miss vector larger than the expected miss at TCA), so the
risk at that point is actually higher. In the more extreme cases, such as that shown in the above
example (and even more strongly in the one below), most of the risk accumulation can be
relatively far from TCA, meaning that methods that examine the situation only at TCA can
misrepresent this risk.

Figure N-6 Pc Rate and Cumulative Pc for a Low Velocity Conjunction
Figure N-6 shows the collision rate (left) and the cumulative Pc (right) for low relative velocity
conjunction (~3 m/s), that fails to satisfy the rectilinear motion, temporally isolated, and
Gaussian PDF assumptions. In this case, the three-dimensional Nc algorithm estimates a Pc
value which matches the Monte Carlo from TCA method Pc estimate, but that is a factor of 330
larger than the erroneous conjunction plane Pc estimate.

N.4 Two-dimensional Nc Method Analytic Pc Calculations
As formulated in equations (N-5) and (N-6), the three-dimensional Nc method requires the
computation of a time-series of many unit-sphere integrations, each calculated using Lebedev
quadrature. However, for temporally isolated conjunctions (i.e., those that are not ‚Äúextended‚Äù or
‚Äúblended‚Äù in time as described by Hall 2021), the integration over time can be approximated
analytically, ultimately yielding a single unit-sphere integral. This relatively efficient ‚Äútwodimensional Nc‚Äù method yields accurate Pc estimates for high velocity, temporally isolated
conjunctions (such as the example shown in Figure N-5). However, it is not applicable to low
velocity events that are temporally extended or blended (as shown in Figure N-6); these
conjunctions still require the use of the three-dimensional Nc method or Monte Carlo estimation.
The first step in the ‚Äútwo-dimensional Nc‚Äù formulation involves rewriting the MVN function in

The first term of the ùëÑùëÖ,ùë° expression corresponds to an effective Mahalanobis distance that
accounts for curvilinear trajectory effects, a function which typically experiences a minimum in
time near (but not exactly at) TCA. The second term typically varies slowly in time relative to
the first. The next step of the derivation entails numerically finding the minimum of the function

ùëÑ0,ùë° (i.e., the function ùëÑùëÖ,ùë° evaluated at ùëÖ = 0, which corresponds to the center of the collision
sphere) and denotes the time that this minimum occurs as ùëá. In other words, ùëá = ùëéùëüùëîùëöùëñùëõ(ùëÑ0,ùë° ).
For high velocity conjunctions, this time usually occurs within a few seconds of the TCA (and
often much less). The next step is to expand the function ùëÑùëÖ,ùë° to second order about the time ùëá,
yielding the simplified approximation

For this, the required time derivatives ùëÑÃáùëÖ,ùëá and ùëÑÃàùëÖ,ùëá are estimated numerically using finite
difference equations (Press et al., 1989). Note, for brevity, the functional dependence on ùíìÃÇ has
been suppressed for all of the quantities expressed in equations (N-9) and (N-10). Combining
equations (N-5) through (N-10) allows the time integral to be evaluated analytically, and yields

which in turn depends on the angles ùúë and ùúÉ. Equation (N-10) entails two-dimensional
numerical integration over the unit sphere, calculated using Lebedev quadrature. (The function
Pc2D_Hall of the NASA CARA SDK repository computes Pc estimates for temporally isolated
conjunctions using the two-dimensional Nc method.)

N.5 Comparison of Pc Estimates for Temporally Isolated Conjunctions
Figure N-7 shows a comparison of collision probabilities for 63,603 temporally isolated
conjunctions extracted from the NASA CARA database for the period 2017-05-01 and
2019-08-15 and for events with 2D ùëÉùëê > 10-7 (Hall, 2021). The vertical axes on all three panels
plot Monte Carlo (MC) estimates for the collision probability‚éØspecifically, Monte Carlo from
TCA method Pc estimates, which are also referred to in this figure as two-body Monte Carlo
method Pc estimates (i.e., TBMC-Pc estimates, as described in more detail in section N.13). The
error bars in Figure N-7 show 95% confidence intervals estimated using the Clopper-Pearson
method (1934); several of the conjunctions had zero hits registered in the Monte Carlo
simulations, which are represented in Figure N-7 using downward-pointing triangles and a
single-sided error bar. The horizontal axes plot the corresponding semi-analytical
approximations: two-dimensional Pc on the left graph, three-dimensional Nc in the center, and
two-dimensional Nc on the right. The colored points on each plot indicate the results of a

binomial proportion statistical test that evaluates the agreement between the estimates.
Specifically, black points in Figure N-7 indicate analytical Pc estimates that agree reasonably
well with the Monte Carlo estimates as they do not violate a null-hypothesis that the two are
equal at a p-value ÔÇ£ 10-3 significance level. However, those highlighted in yellow do violate the
hypothesis at this significance level, and those in red at a more stringent level of p-value ÔÇ£ 10-6.
Overall, the two-dimensional conjunction plane Pc comparison plotted in the left graph contains
254 yellow and 436 red points, which both significantly exceed the number of disagreements
expected from purely statistical variations, even though together they represent a small fraction
(~1%) of the original conjunctions. These disagreements represent conjunctions that violate one
or more of the assumptions required for conjunction plane Pc estimation. The center graph
clearly shows that the three-dimensional Nc method matches the Monte Carlo Pc estimates
better, producing only 66 yellow and zero red points. Finally, the two-dimensional Nc method
plotted on the right produces very nearly the same results as the three-dimensional Nc method
but requires much less computation time. The three comparisons shown in Figure N-7 indicate
that, for temporally isolated conjunctions, the two- and three-dimensional Nc methods are
consistent with one another and match Monte Carlo Pc estimates significantly better than the
conjunction plane Pc estimation method.

N.6 Pc Calculations for Multi-encounter Interactions
An additional feature of the two- and three-dimensional Nc methods is their ability to address
explicitly the amalgamated risk of repeating conjunctions. While most conjunctions are
temporally isolated, there are two conjunction types that exhibit different behaviors. The first
type is produced by objects in orbits in synodic alignment that generate a temporal sequence of
conjunctions once every revolution or multiple of a revolution (e.g., two nearly circular orbits at
different inclinations that produce conjunctions at one or both nodal crossing points). The second
type involves objects that orbit close to each other for extended periods, generating extended
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

141

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

interactions with multiple close approaches (e.g., two satellites in nearly the same orbit, but with
only a slight difference in inclination and/or eccentricity). In both cases, if each of the multiple
encounters is considered separately, situations can arise in which each encounter in the series
falls below a Pc mitigation threshold, but the combined risk of all of the encounters exceeds that
threshold. The two- and three-dimensional Nc methods account for such multi-encounter
interactions by providing estimates for the total expected number of collisions, and upper and
lower bounds for the probability of collision (Hall, 2021). The total statistically expected number
of collisions for a multi-encounter interaction is given by a summation of Nc values for each
conjunction in the sequence

a five-hour period. Each of the individual conjunctions produces a Pc value in the upper yellow
region (between 10-5 and 10-4), as plotted in the bottom panel. The solid line in the top panel
shows the upper limit of the cumulative Pc for the interaction; notably, after the third
conjunction, the cumulative Pc exceeds 10-4 ‚Äî a value frequently selected as a risk mitigation
threshold. So, while these events would not necessarily prompt a mitigation action if examined
individually, when considered collectively they do appear to represent a situation of sufficiently
high collision likelihood to warrant mitigation. In such a case, it is advisable to run a Monte
Carlo investigation (discussed in a subsequent section of this appendix) to verify that the upperlimit Pc value generated by the method is in fact representative of the actual cumulative risk. The
utility of the analytic calculation, however, should be clear: if the upper-bound calculation for
repeating events is found to be below the mitigation threshold, then there is no need to marshal
computationally intensive methods (such as Monte Carlo), for it has already been demonstrated
no mitigation action is warranted.

N.7 Input Covariance Data Considerations
Most calculations are only as good as the input data that drive them, and Pc calculation is no
exception. Appendix P discusses orbit determination quality and propagation issues for
individual objects and addresses the question of the circumstances under which the state estimate
and covariance might be considered sufficiently poor so as not to constitute a basis for
conjunction risk mitigation actions. The purpose of this section is to address the routine
improvement and basic error checking extended to covariances as part of the Pc calculation.
These activities fall into three basic groups: correction for known problems in propagation,
covariance formation and stability issues, and correlation between primary and secondary
covariances. Each of these topics will be treated in turn.
N.7.1 Propagation Error Compensation
Historically, accuracy analysis of state estimate and uncertainty estimates has focused on
products that emerge directly from the orbit determination fit. These direct orbit-determination
products include best-estimate states and covariances of the satellite at an epoch that usually
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

143

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
coincides with the acquisition time of the last tracking metric observation incorporated into the
analysis. While these direct orbit-determination products are of course foundational, it is
important to remember that most SSA activities, and conjunction assessment in particular, are
not usually conducted with these direct products but rather with predictions propagated from the
orbit-determination epoch solution, often over a non-trivial duration that spans many orbital
revolutions into the future. The batch orbit-determination analysis method used by the DOD
produces a formation covariance that represents the expected at-epoch state uncertainty based on
the number, quantity, and temporal spacing of the incorporated metric observations; when the
state is propagated forward, a parallel process can also be used to propagate the covariance
forward in time. The same dynamical models used for the orbit-determination analysis as well as
the state propagation itself are used to perform this covariance propagation, although in a
linearized way. This means that the propagated covariance will be sized (mostly) appropriately
for both the propagation duration and the final prediction point in the orbit.
Despite the use of appropriate models to propagate the covariance forward in time, a number of
additional sources of error manifest themselves during the propagation interval yet are not part of
the dynamical model used during the fit; these errors are therefore neither incorporated into the
orbit-determination-produced covariance nor added as part of the regular propagation process.
Because of the prevalence of such outside-of-model errors, techniques have been developed to
account for them, the most familiar of which is the addition of process noise during propagation.
Originally developed to account for acceleration errors that, due to model inadequacy, were to
some degree known, this method propagates a noise matrix alongside the propagated covariance
and combines both matrices as part of the overall process. The result is a covariance that is larger
than it would have been otherwise to account for these (characterized) errors in the force
model(s). A second approach, which is the one used by DOD in the propagation of their orbit
prediction products, applies parameters to the covariance before propagation to guide the
propagation process in producing a more realistic result. Because this is the approach reflected in
the CDM covariances that conjunction assessment practitioners receive from the DOD, it will be
described here in some detail.
Orbit determination makes a distinction between ‚Äúsolved-for‚Äù parameters that are actually
estimated during an orbit-determination activity, and ‚Äúconsider‚Äù parameters that are not ‚Äúsolved
for‚Äù but represent a priori information that is ‚Äúconsidered‚Äù as part of the orbit-determination
process. In the present case, the use of the term ‚Äúconsider parameter‚Äù is somewhat non-nominal
in that it is referring not to additions or alterations made during the fit but to modifications to the
fit-produced covariance so that when it is propagated, it may give a more realistic representation
of the expected state errors. For DOD covariances, two different consider parameters are applied
to compensate for two distinct expected errors during propagation: atmospheric density forecast
error and satellite frontal area uncertainty.
Atmospheric drag is a significant force that affects satellite orbits with perigee heights less than
1000 km, and the calculation of the expected atmospheric drag at any particular moment requires
an estimate of the neutral atmospheric density that that satellite will encounter at that moment.
Because the atmospheric models that generate this estimate are driven by space weather indices,
the ability to predict these indices accurately affects the fidelity of the predicted atmospheric

density and thus the atmospheric drag. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict future space
weather indices well, primarily because they are affected by activities on the part of the sun‚Äôs
surface that has not yet rotated into view from the Earth. This particular issue was studied with
the Jacchia-Bowman High Accuracy Satellite Drag Model (HASDM) 2009, which is the
atmospheric density model used by DOD, by comparing predicted densities (using predicted
space weather indices) to actual densities and producing polynomial fits of the relative density
error as a function of satellite perigee height and the Ap (major magnetic storms list) and Dst
(disturbance storm-time) space weather indices. Figure N-9 shows the behavior of these
polynomial fits divided into four different classes of Ap/Dst activity; y-axis values are omitted
here to allow full releasability of the figure:

Figure N-9 Behavior of Relative Density Error by Perigee Height and
Solar Activity
These fits produce a variance term that can be added to the ballistic coefficient variance in the
covariance: because in the drag equation the ballistic coefficient and the atmospheric density
estimate are multiplicatively coupled, changing one of these parameters has the same effect as
changing the other. When the covariance is propagated, this augmented term will appropriately
expand the other covariance terms.
The amount of drag acceleration a satellite encounters is also governed by the frontal area that
the satellite presents to the atmosphere; this makes intuitive sense (amount of resistance is a
function of area presented to the resisting fluid) and is reflected in the ballistic coefficient (B)
equation

B = CD

A
M

(N-14)

in which CD is the (dimensionless) drag coefficient, which indicates the degree to which the
satellite surface is susceptible to drag resistance; M is the satellite mass; and A is the satellite
frontal area. As A increases, B increases as well, increasing the overall drag acceleration value.
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

145

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Stabilized satellites should manifest a stable B term, but rotating satellites, because their frontal
area term is continuously changing, can exhibit a range of B terms. Three outcomes are possible
depending on the rapidity of the rotation: the effect can be washed out during the fit (because the
rotation is so rapid that an average value is quite representative), the effect can be not relevant
during the fit (because the rotation is so slow that it does not affect near-term look-back and
look-forward), or the effect can be such that the rotation does affect results fit-to-fit. It is this last
case for which compensation is helpful. A history of regularized B histories for individual
satellites is examined and a relative error and variance calculated, and this variance is added to
the drag variance in the covariance as a corrective term whose influence will be realized in
propagation.
There is some additional subtlety regarding the exact way these consider parameters are applied.
A typical propagation consists of two conceptual stages: the first stage is the propagation forward
from the epoch time of the orbit determination to the present time, which can make use of
measured and thus highly reliable space weather indices; and the second stage is from the present
time to the desired final propagation time, which has to use predicted space weather indices and
the errors that these introduce. The two consider parameters are thus applied at different times.
Because satellite rotation and its resultant uncertainty will occur for the entire interval from
epoch time to the propagation end point, that consider parameter is applied at epoch.
Atmospheric density forecast error, however, is encountered only forward in time from the
present moment, so it is added only for that portion of the propagation. Figure N-10 outlines the
two-phase application of these consider parameters:

DCP = Dynamic Consider Parameter
Figure N-10 Two-phase Application of Consider Parameters
If the CDMs generated by the DOD are used for conjunction assessment applications, the good
news is that all the consider parameter activities described above are already performed‚Äîthe
propagated covariances that the CDM contains have had these two consider parameters applied
during the covariance propagation executed at the DOD work center. If one is working with
epoch state estimates, which is sometimes necessary when performing Pc calculations with
Monte Carlo techniques, then manual application of the consider parameters may be necessary.
This issue is discussed at greater length in the section that addresses Monte Carlo Pc
calculations.

N.7.2 Defective Covariances
There are several ways in which a covariance contained in a CDM can be defective.
‚Ä¢

Null Covariances. All-zero, or null, covariances are sometimes observed, usually arising
from a conjunction assessment screening for which the O/O-provided ephemeris does not
contain covariance data. In such a case, it is possible to compute the Pc either using only
the one covariance that the CDM message contains or by applying a special technique
that determines the maximum Pc possible presuming that the null covariance could take
on any possible value (developed and described in Frisbee 2015).

‚Ä¢

Default Covariances. Default covariances are diagonal covariances that contain a value
of ten earth radii squared for each of the three position variances. The presence of this
covariance indicates that a precision, special-perturbation solution for the object was not
possible; the state estimate provided arose from a general-perturbation solution, and an
orbit-determination-produced covariance was not available. Such a result is not a
precision solution and does not constitute a basis for conjunction risk mitigation actions.

‚Ä¢

Non-Positive-Semidefinite Covariances. Another defective covariance type found in
CDMs, now quite rare due to improvements to the DOD operational system, is a
covariance that fails to be positive semidefinite. A positive semidefinite matrix is one that
contains no negative eigenvalues. Because the covariance represents a hyperellipsoid of
actual state error information, it must have a set of eigenvalues all greater than or equal to
zero for error information to consist of real rather than imaginary quantities. The orbitdetermination mechanism that generates the covariance should always produce at least a
positive semidefinite matrix, for the linear algebra function involves the product of a
square matrix and its transpose, and one can prove that this procedure always produces a
positive semidefinite result. Due to either numerical precision limits or interpolation, the
provided matrix is sometimes not positive semidefinite. If the 2 √ó 2 projection of the
covariance matrix into the conjunction plane is not positive semidefinite, the twodimensional Pc calculation is not possible. If the full 6 √ó 6 or 8 √ó 8 matrix is not positive
semidefinite, then Monte Carlo sampling on the entire matrix is not possible either.

As such, some attention must be paid to this issue of positive semidefinite matrix conditioning. A
recent paper on this subject (Hall 2017b) examined the issue in some detail and compared
different matrix repair algorithms to minimally adjust the covariance to make it positive
semidefinite compliant; it found that most repair approaches yield equivalent answers in terms of
the resultant calculated Pc. An ‚Äúeigenvalue clipping‚Äù procedure was developed in which any
negative eigenvalues (which are almost always small) are set to a small positive or zero value, as
required.
The CARA operational implementation of this method proceeds parsimoniously, namely by
directing such repair only to the level needed to perform a calculation. For example, a covariance
used for the two-dimensional Pc calculation would neither be tested for positive semidefinite
compliance in its full 8 x 8 form nor its position-only 3 x 3 form; instead, the 2 x 2 projection of
the joint covariance into the conjunction plane would be tested and repaired only when necessary
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

147

to enable the two-dimensional Pc calculation. To do otherwise is to make repairs and potentially
alter the result when this is not strictly necessary.
The Pc Computation CARA SDK includes the source code for identifying the need for and
making the covariance matrix repairs described above; it is available in the NASA CARA
software repository. (See Section 7, Contact Information in this document for the specific URL.)

N.7.3 Covariance Correlation
For nearly all the broader conjunction assessment conduct during the past decade, practitioners
operated with the presumption that the primary and secondary objects‚Äô covariances could be
considered uncorrelated. Not only was this the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer in that it greatly simplified the Pc
computation because the joint covariance could be formed by simple addition of the two
covariances, but there was also a good intuitive justification for the presumption. Because the
focus had been on the two objects‚Äô orbit-determination fits, which are based on separate sets of
observations, there was no expectation that there would exist any significant correlation between
the two objects‚Äô covariances. The principal source of potentially correlated error was presumed
to be uncharacterized but correlated errors in space sensor observations used by both primary and
secondary objects. Because most primaries receive many observations from many different
sensors, it was seen as unlikely that this particular source would introduce much correlation.
Correlation between covariances was thus expected to be small, and conjunction assessment
operators proceeded as though it were.
With the initiative several years ago to include outside-of-fit prediction error characterization
into DOD satellite covariances (see the above section on Propagation Error Compensation), the
issue of covariance cross-correlation began to be rethought. The principal outside-of-fit
prediction error is global atmospheric density forecast error due to inadequate space weather
index prediction. Because this is a global error, it is likely to be shared among large classes of
objects, some of which might constitute both the primary and secondary objects in a conjunction.
As discussed previously, this global density forecast error has been parameterized by satellite
perigee height and predicted geomagnetic index, so the degree of such error, both identified
separately and injected into each DOD-furnished covariance by means of a consider parameter,
is known for each satellite. It is possible to determine the degree of shared error from this source
and account for it when forming the joint covariance.
A study by Casali et al. (2018) provides a full development of this theory and presents results for
an evaluation set of conjunction data. Essentially, one has to determine the global density
forecast error relevant to each satellite and the degree to which the associated drag error induced
by this density forecast error will manifest itself in position error relevant to the particular
conjunction. The governing equation is the following:
Pm = Ps + Pp - ÔÅ≥s/g ÔÅ≥p/g Gs GTp - ÔÅ≥s/g ÔÅ≥p/g Gp GTs

(N-15)

in which Pm is the decorrelated joint covariance at TCA, Ps is the secondary covariance at TCA,
Pp is the primary covariance at TCA, œÉs/g is the density forecast error germane to the secondary
satellite, œÉp/g is the density forecast error germane to the primary satellite, Gs is the sensitivity
vector mapping drag acceleration error to secondary satellite position error at TCA, and Gp is the
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

148

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

sensitivity vector mapping drag acceleration error to primary satellite position error at TCA. One
could wonder how the conjunction assessment practitioner would come upon all of the needed
data to effect the proposed compensation. A recent enhancement to the DOD operational system
has placed all of this information in the CDM itself, allowing the direct calculation of the
decorrelated joint covariance. The CARA Pc Calculation SDK, available on the NASA CARA
software repository, contains both a math specification outlining this calculation and source code
to perform it. (See Section 7, Contact Information in this document for the URL.) Hall (2021)
describes how the density forecast errors and sensitivity vectors can be used to estimate
decorrelated joint covariances for the two- and three-dimensional Nc methods.
A heuristic probing of the situation reveals that, conjunction by conjunction, different levels of
Pc changes are possible due to cross-correlation remediation. Orbits that are insensitive to
atmospheric drag are little affected by density forecast error and will have Pc estimates that, as
expected, also change little. Head-on conjunctions are expected to be left mostly unaffected as
well, for the components of the error that govern the Pc are not subject to density forecast error
perturbation. Crossing events are perhaps the most susceptible to cross-correlation effects,
especially if the drag level of both satellites is similar.
The plot in Figure N-11 profiles 250 conjunctions in which the primary and secondary satellites
are of non-negligible drag (i.e., Energy Dissipation Rate (EDR) values greater than 0.0006
watts/kg; see Hejduk 2008 for an explanation of energy dissipation rate) and plots the ratio of the
Pc calculated with the decorrelated joint covariance to that of the Pc calculated with the
unmodified joint covariance. One can see that for somewhat more than half of the events, the
ratio hovers near unity, meaning that the conjunction is little affected by the compensation. For
about one-third of the cases, the decrease in Pc is notable, in many instances more than an order
of magnitude. For the remaining cases, there is an increase in Pc from a factor of 1.5 to 5.

Satellites of Non-negligible Drag14
While the Pc value changes by less than a factor of 1.5 for most of the conjunctions, a sufficient
number are affected more substantially therefore justifying the integration of this additional
consideration into the Pc computation, especially because it is a straightforward calculation from
data provided directly in the CDM.

N.8 Monte Carlo Pc Calculation Techniques
Analytic approaches to Pc calculation are more computationally efficient than Monte Carlo
methods, especially the conjunction plane two-dimensional Pc method. However, as discussed
previously, analytic methods require certain enabling assumptions that are not necessarily valid
for all conjunctions. Monte Carlo approaches require fewer enabling assumptions, but they are
not typically employed as the first method of computation. Instead, Monte Carlo methods are
usually reserved for cases that are suspected of violating the enabling assumptions of the analytic
methods. As described by Hall et al. (2018) and Hall (2021), there are two strains of the Monte
Carlo method that are regularly employed:
‚Ä¢

‚ÄúMonte Carlo from epoch,‚Äù in which the orbit-determination-epoch mean states and
covariances are used to generate sampled states, and potentially long (i.e., multiday)
high-fidelity propagations are required for each Monte Carlo trial.

‚Ä¢

‚ÄúMonte Carlo from TCA,‚Äù in which the mean states and covariances predicted at TCA
are used to generate sampled states, and only relatively short propagations to each trial‚Äôs
new TCA are required.

Each of these two approaches will be discussed in turn.

N.8.1 Monte Carlo from Epoch

14

From Casali et al. 2018.

Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

150

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
The principal appeal of calculating the Pc using the Monte Carlo from epoch approach is that it
requires almost no simplifying or restrictive assumptions, making it is as close to a ‚Äúgold
standard‚Äù for Pc estimation as can be devised. The input information includes the states and
covariances for the primary and secondary objects at their respective orbit-determination epoch
times, the combined hard-body radius of the two objects, and an ensemble of environmental
datasets required for the high-fidelity propagations (such as predicted space weather indices and
atmospheric density debiasing data; see Hall et al. 2018). The most elaborate instantiation of this
technique uses the full eight-dimensional orbital state vectors (each containing six coordinate or
element variables, plus drag and solar radiation pressure variables) along with the associated 8x8
covariance matrices for the primary and secondary satellites.
For each Monte Carlo trial, a state perturbation is obtained by performing a random draw from
the distribution using the covariance matrix to generate the associated Gaussian distribution for
each variable. These perturbations are then used to alter the initial states by adding each to the
appropriate epoch mean state estimates. To do this for the primary satellite, for example, one
would generate random perturbations for the eight variables representing the primary satellite‚Äôs
state based on their distribution as defined by the covariance, and then create a new, sampled
state vector by adding the (signed) perturbations to the mean epoch state vector. This same
procedure would also be performed for the secondary satellite. This sampling process generates
epoch states for both the primary and secondary objects that represent statistically reasonable
alternatives for their actual states. These two sampled epoch states are then propagated forward,
a TCA identified, and a check performed to determine whether the miss distance at TCA is
smaller than the hard-body radius; if it is, the trial results in a simulated collision and a ‚Äúhit‚Äù is
registered; if not, it is considered a ‚Äúmiss.‚Äù This sampling/ propagation/ hit-registration
procedure is then repeated for a large number of Monte Carlo trials, and the final number of hits
divided by the total number of trials constitutes the Monte Carlo Pc estimate. There are
algorithms that can be applied to estimate the confidence interval on the Monte Carlo Pc after a
given number of trials due to event counting uncertainties (e.g., MATLAB‚Äôs binofit function).
This procedure seems straightforward enough, and in many respects it is. But there are subtleties
that require attention, especially if the technique is deployed for LEO conjunctions:
‚Ä¢

For the result to be valid, the same force models and force model settings must be used
for the Monte Carlo propagations as were used when generating the original orbitdetermination solution. While it often is not difficult to apply the same general force
model settings, there does need to be overall compatibility between the orbitdetermination engine and the Monte Carlo propagator, such as the same set of
geopotential Legendre polynomial coefficients (not just the same geopotential order) and,
most critically for LEO, the same atmospheric density model. While it may be possible to
deviate somewhat from this level of compatibility and still obtain reasonably accurate
outcomes, the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù propriety of the result is lost.

‚Ä¢

Correlation between the primary and secondary covariances, as described in the previous
section, should be considered. This correlation can be modeled during the random draw
process by forcing correlation in the primary and secondary objects‚Äô drag perturbations.

Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

‚Ä¢

Monte Carlo from epoch often requires extremely long computation run times. The run
time is a function of the actual Pc, since this will determine how often hits are likely to
occur and the number of trials required to obtain a result with a desired confidence level.
Without marshalling extensive high-performance computing, the Pc levels that can be
explored with this method have to remain relatively large (e.g., 10-5 or above).
Computation times for smaller Pc events can be prohibitively long. For example,
validating a Pc estimate of ~10-7 at the 95% confidence level for a conjunction with TCA
five days from the orbit determination epoch time would require an estimated two years
of execution time on a 20-CPU, reasonably modern server (Hall et al. 2018). For this
reason, it is typically necessary to reserve the Monte Carlo from epoch method for larger
Pc events only, which means that one must trust analytic methods to identify a candidate
subset of conjunctions for follow-up Monte Carlo analysis.

‚Ä¢

High-fidelity orbital state propagations require the most processing during typical Monte
Carlo from epoch computations, so when applying this approach, there is a temptation to
‚Äúreuse‚Äù propagations to gain computational efficiency. Suppose that ten perturbations
were performed for the primary satellite and ten propagated ephemerides were generated,
and the same was done for the secondary object as well. Ephemeris #1 for the primary
could be compared to ephemeris #1 for the secondary to determine whether a hit
occurred, ephemeris #2 for the primary to ephemeris #2 for the secondary, ephemeris #3
for the primary to ephemeris #3 for the secondary, etc., and have as a result ten
comparisons/trials. To go further, one could compare ephemeris #1 for the primary to
ephemeris #2 for the secondary, ephemeris #1 for the primary to ephemeris #3 for the
secondary, etc., and realize 100 comparisons/trials from merely 20 total propagations.
Such a procedure certainty seems advantageous, given that processing time is the limiting
factor to the deployment of Monte Carlo from epoch, and following such a procedure will
produce a result that converges on the true Pc. The drawback is that such reuse of
samples violates the conditions for the proper application of the formulae to calculate Pc
uncertainty confidence intervals. Monte Carlo results without associated reliable
confidence intervals are not operationally useful because it is never known how close one
is to the true Pc value. Schilling et al. (2016) discuss this issue and confirm it to be a
problem, and they recommend some estimation techniques that allow (large) confidence
intervals to be constructed around Monte Carlo products that avail themselves of sample
reuse. The CARA implementation has avoided any such sample reuse to ensure that the
‚Äúgold standard‚Äù status of the results not be in question and to produce more narrow
confidence intervals.

Due to all the above considerations, but especially the run-time requirements, Monte Carlo from
epoch is usually reserved only for those cases that require it for accurate Pc estimation.
A study effort discussed in greater detail in the next section determined that the Monte Carlo
from epoch method appears to be needed only when the two objects stay in such close proximity
that they experience a sequence of multiple, comparable-risk close approaches during a multiday
risk assessment projection interval. For closely spaced co-orbiting objects, these conjunctions
may also become effectively ‚Äúblended‚Äù in time with one another such that collision probability

152

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
accumulates appreciably even during the mid-point times between the encounters rather than just
during short bursts very near the close approaches (Baars et al. 2019). In such cases, two
impediments arise to estimating accurate Pc values using methods formulated for temporally
isolated close approaches. First, there is no clear, single TCA at which to evaluate the collision
likelihood. While one could in fact find the unique point of closest approach between the two
nominal trajectories for the entire sequence and perform a two-dimensional Pc calculation for
that encounter, there is no guarantee that another encounter in the sequence may actually possess
a higher Pc due to different covariance orientations even though it has a larger nominal miss
distance. Second, calculating a single encounter Pc at each of the close approaches and then
amalgamating these using the following formula (derived from DeMorgan‚Äôs Law of
Complements)

(N-16)

potentially overestimates the overall collision likelihood because it presumes that the individual
events in the sequence are statistically independent, but in fact they may not be, especially if
blended in time. This total probability estimate matches that given in equation (N-13) and
provides an upper bound for the amalgamated risk over the time interval of interest. For
maximum efficiency, Monte Carlo from epoch would then be run operationally only in cases in
which this upper bound is above a mitigation threshold and there is interest in determining
whether the higher-fidelity Monte Carlo calculation would reduce this value to one much closer
to or below the threshold. Monte Carlo from epoch can also be run if there is any question about
the overall rectitude of the Pc calculation. As stated earlier, lower-Pc conjunctions may present
intractable Monte Carlo execution times, but if one wishes only to ensure that the Monte Carlo
Pc falls below the mitigation threshold (rather than establish a high-fidelity Pc value), this can
usually be accomplished with far fewer Monte Carlo trials.
Optimal application of the Monte Carlo from epoch Pc estimation method does not entail Pc
evaluation over a relatively short time interval bracketing a single conjunction‚Äôs TCA, but rather
over a more extended interval that spans several close approach encounters. For example, the
collision likelihood between two objects would not be evaluated at the nominal TCA for a single
conjunction, but, perhaps, over a risk assessment interval projecting forward seven days. This
multiday interval would not only include the original nominal TCA but also a sequence of other
encounters between the primary and secondary as well. In this case, each Monte Carlo trial
would be propagated forward seven days and a hit registered at the earliest time that the hardbody radius is violated, if such a time exists (Hall et al. 2018 and Hall 2021). Temporal risk plots
can be produced using the sequence of hits registered during all the trials, an example of which is
shown in Figure N-12 (which shows the same conjunction sequence as Figure N-8 from the
earlier discussion of two- and three-dimensional Nc calculation methods). The pink shaded area
in Figure N-12 shows the Monte Carlo Pc estimation confidence region, and the pink line shows
the best estimate Monte Carlo result. As can be seen, the black upper line, which is the upper
bound estimate from the three-dimensional Nc function, is within the confidence interval of the
Monte Carlo results and thus is a reasonable actual realization of the repeating conjunctions‚Äô
cumulative risk.

Monte Carlo from Epoch Result Overlay (in Pink)
Because it is complicated to set up the execution environment for the Monte Carlo from epoch
calculation, and because ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù results require assembling extensive environmental data
and software settings identical to the original DOD orbit-determination solutions, it is envisioned
that the ability to run this strain of Monte Carlo estimation will remain with NASA CARA.
However, a more computationally efficient mode of Monte Carlo estimation, which is
serviceable for several different applications and is easier to obtain and employ operationally, is
described in the next section.

N.8.2 Monte Carlo from TCA
A much more computationally efficient variant on Monte Carlo from epoch, which has been
used by conjunction assessment practitioners for some time, is Monte Carlo conducted from
TCA, or two-body Monte Carlo (TBMC)-Pc estimation. As the definition implies, the Monte
Carlo simulation begins with the primary and secondary objects‚Äô equinoctial element states
propagated to TCA. Perturbation and sampling of both states is conducted much as described
earlier for Monte Carlo from epoch, and each sampled primary and secondary state is propagated
both forward and backward in time to find the pair‚Äôs TCA and determine whether the
corresponding miss distance is smaller than the hard-body radius (backward propagations are
required to register hits that occur at times before TCA). The simplification arises from the fact
that, since one is beginning from TCA, the propagations required will be short. This means that
an efficient two-body motion propagation scheme usually provides an accurate trajectory

154

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

approximation, and this, combined with the very short propagation times, vastly improves the
computational efficiency of the calculation‚Äîby a factor of 10,000 to 100,000 according to the
study by Hall et al. (2018). This specific method of Monte Carlo from TCA is also referred to as
‚Äútwo-body Monte Carlo‚Äù Pc (TBMC-Pc) estimation. To use the TBMC-Pc method, the
conjunction duration needs to be short so that one may safely presume a single, unblended event
that does not require the Monte Carlo from epoch method. As a second condition, one must have
confidence that both objects‚Äô states and covariances propagated to TCA are good representations
of the states and state uncertainties at that point. Usually, there is reasonable confidence in the
mean state estimates themselves, but the covariances are a different matter: a number of studies
(e.g., DeMars et al. 2014) have indicated that propagated covariances represented in Cartesian
space fail to represent the actual uncertainty distributions, due both to the potential failure of the
linearized dynamics to remain representative over long propagation intervals and, more
importantly, a mismatch between elongated in-track uncertainty volumes and the forced
representation of these uncertainty volumes as Cartesian ellipsoids. The latter problem is
illustrated in Figure N-13. The actual in-track error volume should follow the curved trajectory
of the orbit, but the Cartesian covariance is limited to the rectilinear representation shown: as the
elongation grows in the in-track direction (which occurs for longer propagations), the mismatch
between the two representations also increases.

r

Figure N-13 Mismatch between Elongated In-track Covariances and
Forced Cartesian Ellipsoidal Representation
To address the latter problem, the results from a study conducted by Sabol et al. (2010) are both
important and extremely helpful. This study addressed directly the question of the optimal choice
of orbital state representation for covariances, finding that it is not the specific state
representation in which the propagation is executed but rather the one in which the propagated
covariance is rendered that ultimately governs the realism of the uncertainty distribution and
associated error volume. Specifically, if the covariance is rendered and used in a curvilinear state
representation, such as equinoctial elements, then it tends to represent the error volume much
more accurately than if it is transformed and used in Cartesian coordinates. The surprising result
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

155

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
is that a non-representative Cartesian covariance transformed into an equinoctial covariance
becomes a representative covariance. Furthermore, taking random samples using the equinoctial
state representation and performing the non-linear conversion of each sample to Cartesian
coordinates generates a point cloud in the Cartesian frame that also approximates the true error
volume much more accurately.
This latter procedure allows the Monte Carlo from TCA method to employ more realistic
uncertainty volumes, at least with respect to orbital state representation-related mismatches. The
detailed procedure is the following:
1. Convert both objects‚Äô states and covariances at TCA to equinoctial elements.
2. Generate a set of perturbations for each object based on the equinoctial covariances.
3. Combine these with the mean equinoctial states to generate sampled equinoctial states for
the primary and secondary.
4. Convert these sampled states from equinoctial elements to Cartesian coordinates using
the non-linear transformation.
5. Propagate the Cartesian states for both the primary and secondary using two-body
equations of motion to find the new TCA, which may precede or follow the nominal
TCA.
6. Determine whether the new miss distance is less than the hard-body radius, and if so,
register a hit at the time that the hard-body radius sphere is violated.
7. Repeat steps 5-6 until the entire set of Monte Carlo sampling trials has been processed.
8. The Pc is the number of hits divided by the total number of trials, and the confidence
interval can be calculated from an appropriate formula.
This approach seems reasonable enough; but it would be presumptuous to assert, without further
study, that it is truly robust, especially since the question of the durability of the linearized
dynamics typically used to propagate covariances was not directly addressed. As it is, additional
study efforts have been performed to verify that it is indeed sufficiently representative for
conjunction assessment applications, and they are described below.
The first of these study efforts was performed as part of the previously cited analysis by Hall et
al. (2018). A set of 373 high-Pc conjunctions was selected and evaluated with both Monte Carlo
from epoch and Monte Carlo from TCA, and the comparative results are shown in Figure N-14.
The top window is a scatter plot of the Pc calculated by Monte Carlo from epoch versus that
from Monte Carlo from TCA. The intersection of each ‚Äúplus‚Äù sign gives the scatter-plot point,
and the length of the plus-symbol tails indicates the uncertainty of the calculation. One can see
that the agreement is strong because all the points are close to the dashed y-x line that would
indicate perfect equality. The bottom window plots the base-ten logarithm of the ratio of Pc
values estimated using the Monte Carlo from epoch method to those estimated with the Monte
Carlo from TCA method. The largest deviations are about 0.2 of an order of magnitude in Pc,
which is considered to be below operational significance. A separate statistical test for similarity
of results produced p-values all less than 10-3, indicating that one should reject a hypothesis that

these results arise from different distributions. Good agreement is thus observed between the
abbreviated Monte Carlo from TCA and Monte Carlo from epoch results.

Figure N-14 Comparative Results of 373 High-Pc Conjunctions 15
The second study effort involved a comparison between the Monte Carlo from TCA Pc
estimation method and the two-dimensional Pc method (Hall 2019b), which was later extended
to compare the from TCA method to two- and three-dimensional Nc methods (Hall 2021). In
these studies, 63,603 temporally isolated conjunction events with two-dimensional Pc values
greater than 10-7 were subjected to Pc calculation by the two-dimensional Pc method, as well as
the two- and three-dimensional Nc methods, and all of these were compared to the Monte Carlo
from TCA method. The comparative results are shown in Figure N-15 (which refers to Pc values
estimated using the Monte Carlo from TCA method as TBMC-Pc values). These plots are similar
to those already shown in Figure N-7, except in this case the colored diamonds represent the
worst kind of Pc estimation failure, i.e., conjunctions in which the analytical calculations
significantly underestimate the Monte Carlo from TCA method Pc values. The left panel shows
that, although the two-dimensional Pc method performs reasonably well for the vast majority of
temporally isolated conjunctions, it underestimates from TCA Pc values by a factor of 1.5 or
more in 0.258% of the investigated cases. (See the top legend of the left graph.) For those cases
that showed large disparities, the subset that had true Pc values in the tractable range for Monte
Carlo from epoch were validated with this methodology; and in each case the Monte Carlo from

epoch reruns matched the output from the Monte Carlo from TCA. To the degree that nonrepresentative covariances may be responsible for two-dimensional Pc failures (due to coordinate
frame mismatches), Monte Carlo from TCA certainly appears to be able to recover the true Pc.
As an aside, some of these differences between the conjunction plane two-dimensional Pc
estimates and the Monte Carlo method estimates are considerable; there are several cases in
which the two-dimensional Pc estimate understates the Monte Carlo from TCA estimate by more
than an order of magnitude, as shown in the red in the left panel of Figure N-15. The center and
left panels of Figure N-15 show that the three- and two-dimensional Nc methods do not similarly
underestimate the from TCA Pc method values, except in a few statistically insignificant cases.

Figure N-15 Comparative Results of 63,603 Conjunction Events16
Originally, Monte Carlo from TCA was advanced as a robust and computationally tractable way
to ensure reliable Pc calculations in the face of occasional miscarriage of the two-dimensional Pc
algorithm. However, Figure N-15 demonstrates that the development and testing of the two- and
three-dimensional Nc analytic methods have led NASA CARA to recommend that these methods
supplant routine use of Monte Carlo from TCA. One may still resort to this more
computationally efficient Monte Carlo method if desired, but testing indicates that the Nc
calculation methods outperform Monte Carlo from TCA (in that it accurately matches Pc
estimates for isolated conjunctions and also provides a cumulative risk upper bound for repeating
conjunctions) and is at least an order of magnitude more computationally efficient, especially for
events with small Pc values. Monte Carlo from TCA is a capability available for download from
the NASA CARA software repository,17 and O/Os who are currently using it or a similar
implementation are not urged to take it out of service, but as a Pc calculation approach, it does
not seem to offer any enduring advantage over the two- and three-dimensional Nc methods.
Finally, a dedicated study on covariance Gaussianity was recently conducted (Lechtenberg
2019b). The same set of 44,000 conjunctions used by Hall (2019b) was analyzed for multivariate

normality of the position covariance in Cartesian coordinates. The methodology was to convert
the covariance to equinoctial elements, generate a set of random position samples from this
covariance, convert the sample set to Cartesian coordinates, and apply a multivariate normality
test (here the Henze-Zirkler test) to assess compliance to this distribution. At a 5% significance
level, only 60% of the cases could be considered to conform to a multivariate Gaussian
distribution in Cartesian coordinates. In principle, such conjunctions would be considered
suspect cases whose two-dimensional Pc results would be considered doubtful. As it is, since
such a large fraction of the investigated cases show good agreement between the Monte Carlo at
TCA and the two-dimensional Pc, clearly the Gaussianity of the covariances in the Cartesian
framework does not matter appreciably for the Pc calculation. This result corroborates that of an
earlier study by Ghrist and Plakalovic (2012), which reported similar findings.
How can this be, given that the covariance is integral to the two-dimensional Pc calculation? It is
important to remember that the analyses above are restricted to high-Pc events. For the
probability of collision to be high, significant overlap needs to exist between the primary and
secondary object covariances; this means that the central parts of the covariances, which are
where most of the probability density lies, have to overlap substantially. Such a requirement
makes the behavior of the tails of the covariance much less important, and it is in the tails that
non-Gaussian behavior is most strongly manifested. Even though a good number of conjunctions
fail tests for covariance Gaussianity in Cartesian coordinates, for high-Pc events, this result does
not appear to affect the rectitude of the calculated Pc. A difference probably is observable for
lower-Pc conjunctions, but because these conjunctions are not operationally significant, it is not
operationally important to identify or characterize this phenomenon.
There is the lingering question of the eventual failure of the linearized dynamics in propagating
covariances since DOD covariances are propagated through a pre- and post-multiplication by a
linearized state transition matrix. It is agreed that, given sufficiently long propagations, such an
eventuality should arise. However, the propagation duration required for this problem to manifest
itself substantially is believed to be much longer than encountered for most conjunctions‚Äîon the
order of weeks. This is why more attention is paid to this phenomenon in other areas of SSA
such as uncorrelated track processing for which propagations of 30 days or more may be
required, whereas it is rare for propagations longer than ten days to take place in conjunction
assessment. Of course, fresh tracking data are always appreciated as they shorten the propagation
interval and lend additional confidence to the solution.

N.9 Choosing an Appropriate Hard-Body Radius
As discussed in the first section of this appendix, the hard-body radius represents the combined
size of the primary and secondary objects; the word ‚Äúradius‚Äù is used because this combined size
is typically envisioned as a sphere, and the radius of a sphere is a convenient linear
representation of its size. The hard-body radius is needed for the Pc calculation because it
represents the circle/sphere within which a simultaneous penetration by both the primary and
secondary objects‚Äô trajectories will constitute a presumed collision. It is not just a required input
to the Pc calculation, however, it is also one of the governing parameters of the calculation: the
Pc value represents an integral over the area of the hard-body radius circle (or surface area of the
hard-body radius sphere) and thus in many circumstances, varies roughly in proportion to the
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

159

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
square of the hard-body radius, so an increase of the hard-body radius by a factor of three
increases the calculated Pc by a factor of nine, or nearly one order of magnitude. Because of this
sensitivity, it is important not to overstate the hard-body radius simply for ‚Äúconservatism‚Äù
because the effect on the calculated Pc can be considerable. The best overall strategy for
applying conservatism, should one wish that, is to apply it at the end of the process by lowering
the Pc threshold at which mitigation actions should occur. Injecting conservatism into different
places throughout the Pc calculation makes it difficult to determine how much conservatism has
actually been introduced, whereas addressing this desire through a modification of the Pc
threshold for mitigation allows it to be understood precisely.
Mashiku and Hejduk (2019) recently completed a study of different hard-body radius calculation
and setting strategies, and a streamlined summary of the possibilities examined is provided
below:
1. Large a priori value. For some years it was standard practice simply to choose a hardbody radius value that was notably larger than the expected actual size of the combined
primary and secondary object; 20 meters is a value that was typically used. Perhaps in
the early days of conjunction assessment, this was an acceptable initial screening
strategy to identify potential serious events, and the hard-body radius would then be
reduced when analysis began in earnest. As the space catalog has grown in size, and
especially with the recent growth through the deployment of the Space Fence radar, this
particular strategy merely creates additional false alarms that needlessly burden the
process. Nearly all O/Os have moved away from this hard-body radius strategy.
2. Circumscribing sphere. The use of a circumscribing sphere to set the primary object‚Äôs
hard-body radius is perhaps the most commonly used present operational technique,
which admits of two typical variants: placing the sphere‚Äôs center at the center of mass of
the primary satellite and defining the radius by the length from this center to the
satellite‚Äôs most distant extremity; or allowing the center point to float freely and then
defining the smallest circumscribing sphere. The overall sphere size then has to be
increased by the expected size of the secondary object using either an averaged value or
an estimate for the particular secondary encountered. This size could be obtained either
from known or published dimensions (for intact spacecraft or rocket bodies) or estimated
from remote sensing data, such as radar cross-section or photometric brightness
measurements. In the latter case, the estimated hard-body radius size of the secondary
may also have an associated uncertainty estimate, which can also be incorporated into
the Pc estimation process (as discussed in more detail below).
3. Maximum projected area into any plane. Since the circumscribing sphere described
above most often ends up being projected into the conjunction plane, it is instructive to
examine in more detail the implications of such a projection. Clearly the sphere itself
will project as a circle, but the projection of the three-dimensional spacecraft inside will
necessarily be smaller in area than the projected circle, and for some spacecraft shapes
and orientations, it will be substantially smaller in area. In this latter case, the substantial
‚Äúwhite space‚Äù within the projected circular area not occupied by the primary could
justifiably be excluded in the Pc estimation process, especially for the most common
Appendix N Pc Calculation Approaches

160

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
debris-encounter scenario when the incoming secondary object is much smaller than the
primary asset. A straightforward way to address this issue that does require knowledge
of the satellite‚Äôs actual orientation in relation to the conjunction plane is simply to
determine in advance the maximum area that the satellite can possibly project into any
plane (based on a three-dimensional CAD18 model of the satellite) and use a hard-body
radius circle of that equivalent area (which of course must then be enlarged to include
the estimated size of the secondary) for Pc estimation. It is true that this is a conservative
formulation in that it uses the maximum possible projected area, but this is often
substantially smaller than the area of the projected circumscribing sphere. One could
argue that uncertainty is introduced by using the equivalent circular area rather than a
contour integral to perform the integration over the actual projected shape, but individual
exploratory examples show that this difference is usually negligibly small, and in any
case, the most conservative projection approach should compensate for any differences
in the shape chosen to represent the hard-body radius area for the Pc calculation.
4. Projection into actual conjunction plane. The most accurate, and at the same time the
most difficult, approach is to perform a projection of the primary satellite‚Äôs shape into
the actual conjunction plane. Specifically, this requires a three-dimensional CAD model
of the satellite plus knowledge of its inertial attitude and the orientation of any major
articulating components at TCA along with a calculation to project the resulting shape
into the conjunction plane. Once this projection is obtained, its boundaries have to be
augmented to account for the expected size of the secondary, and the integration of the
joint covariance probability density can take place over this figure via contour
integration or over a more convenient shape of equivalent area. Chan (2019) recently
proposed a method to decompose complex shapes into individual triangles and use an
equivalent-area method to evaluate the Pc for each triangle; the composite Pc is simply
the sum of the Pc values for these individual trials of decomposition.
Each successive approach among the four presented brings greater precision to the hard-body
radius determination but at the same time, additional complexity. A reasonable via media would
appear to be approach 3) above, which keeps the hard-body radius value grounded in reality and
free from excessive conservatism but avoids the difficulties of gathering and maintaining shape
and attitude data to enable a detailed projection calculation for each conjunction.
To facilitate Pc estimation, CARA has undertaken an effort to estimate hard-body radii of
unknown orbiting objects based on radar cross section (RCS) measurements obtained by the
Space Fence radar system (Baars and Hall 2022; Hall and Baars 2022). Even after accounting for
radar calibration irregularities and occasional outlier data points, such RCS measurements have
considerable point-to-point scatter, and the process of converting the RCS data into hard-body
radius estimates introduces considerable additional uncertainty. The resulting hard-body radius
uncertainty PDFs are non-Gaussian, although they can be roughly approximated using a lognormal distribution. Notably, RCS-based hard-body radius estimates are typically uncertain by
factors of two to three, so it is essential that Pc estimates account for these uncertainties. For an

18

Computer-aided Design

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

unknown secondary involved in a conjunction, the RCS-based uncertainty PDF can be used to
calculate a mean hard-body radius estimate, ùëÖÃÖ2 , and an associated variance, ùúéùëÖ22 . As mentioned
previously, for many conjunctions, the estimated Pc value varies roughly in proportion to the
square of the hard-body radius. In these cases, the appropriate hard-body radius to use for Pc
estimation is given by the effective combined hard-body radius
ùëÖeff = ‚àö(ùëÖ1 + ùëÖÃÖ2 )2 + ùúéùëÖ22

(N-17)

with ùëÖ1 representing the primary object‚Äôs hard-body radius, usually established using methods 2
or 3 listed above, as discussed previously. (The current recommendation for the less often used
method 4 is to increase the projected shape of the primary object outwardly on the conjunction
plane by the length ùëÖÃÖ2 + 3ùúéùëÖ2 to produce a conservative Pc estimate, although CARA continues
to research a more accurate approach in these cases.) So for most cases, CARA recommends
calculating Pc values using the combined hard-body radius given in equation (N-17) for all
conjunctions involving secondary objects with uncertain sizes, partly because of the formula‚Äôs
relative simplicity, but primarily because using the effective radius approach reproduces
remarkably well the more accurate RCS-based Pc estimates calculated using Monte Carlo
analyses. (See Hall and Baars 2022 for details.)
Currently, Space Fence RCS measurements sufficient for size estimation are available for over
90% of CARA conjunctions involving unknown secondary objects (Baars and Hall 2022).
Analysis indicates that about 98% of such conjunctions involve secondary objects with mean
hard-body radius estimates less than 35 cm, and only about 0.3% have ùëÖÃÖ2 > 1.5 m. For known
objects (e.g., active or retired payloads, rocket-bodies), this approach tabulates the known hardbody radii with zero uncertainty, along with a reference for the source of the size information.
For unknown objects with sufficient RCS data (which includes a large fraction of tracked LEO
orbital debris objects), this approach tabulates the mean estimated hard-body radius and the 1sigma uncertainty, which can be used in equation (N-17). For reference, this approach also
tabulates the median hard body radius values, as well as the associated 95% and 99% confidence
intervals, as estimated from the actual RCS-based uncertainty PDF. For unknown objects with
insufficient RCS data, one can assign a reasonably conservative default size estimate of 1.5 m.

Appendix O. Collision Consequence
O.1 Introduction
It is common in conjunction assessment circles to speak of ‚Äúcollision risk metrics‚Äù such as the
Probability of Collision (Pc), but in fact, calling such parameters risk metrics is a misnomer. As
was first laid out formally in the literature by Kaplan and Garrick (1981) and has been adapted
and reinforced by NASA‚Äôs own project risk assessment paradigms, risk is actually the
combination of the likelihood of a detrimental event and the consequence if such an event should
come to pass. Conjunction risk assessment metrics such as the Pc are simply measures of
collision likelihood, which is only part of the overall risk assessment. Because conjunction
assessment practice arose originally from individual missions whose focus was to protect their
own spacecraft, it seemed unnecessary to add any considerations beyond collision likelihood.
The loss of the mission‚Äôs spacecraft was considered a catastrophic event to be avoided at all
costs, so all that needed to be evaluated was the likelihood of a collision, which if it took place
was presumed to be fatal to the satellite‚Äôs operation and the mission.
When the conjunction assessment risk analysis for groups of satellites or an entire agency or
nation is considered, however, the problem broadens. There is certainly the desire to see
individual missions protected from catastrophic termination. The particular urgency of protecting
any given spacecraft from premature end-of-mission life is a product of a number of factors such
as the degree to which mission objectives have been met, the age of the satellite, and the
functional redundancy within a constellation. Because the individual mission has the best sense
of these considerations, they are in the best position to assess the consequences of potential
spacecraft loss. However, there is a second parallel consideration, which is the preservation of
orbital corridors from debris pollution to ensure their utility for future missions, both by the
United States and all space-faring nations. The NASA Orbital Debris Program Office (ODPO)
has for some years been the NASA project chartered with this concern. They have outlined
spacecraft design and disposal recommendations to mitigate orbital debris production, but there
has not yet been an effort to establish clear requirements for debris minimization through
on-orbit conjunction assessment activities during mission lifetimes. One of the purposes of the
present document is to lay out best practices for conjunction assessment operations that promote
debris minimization. To reduce the production of debris, one must not only consider the
likelihood of any given collision between a NASA primary satellite and other space objects but
also evaluate the amount of debris that such a conjunction, should it result in a collision, may
engender.

O.2 Debris Production Determination Methodology
It is very much the case that different types of satellite collisions can produce substantially
different amounts of debris. The ODPO has studied this phenomenon in some depth through
staged collisions of satellites with simulated debris objects in vacuum chambers and established
relationships among conjunction parameters and the number and size of the resultant debris
objects (Johnson et al. 2001). The basic distinction is between catastrophic collisions, in which
both the primary and secondary object are fully fragmented and thus generate large amounts of
Appendix O. Collision Consequence

163

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
debris, and non-catastrophic collisions in which the smaller/lighter satellite is fully fragmented
but the larger/heavier satellite only cratered, generating much smaller amounts of debris. The
catastrophic/non-catastrophic distinction is governed by the following relationship, based on the
relative kinetic energy of the encounter:
ùúÄ=

2
min (ùëÄ1 , ùëÄ2 ) ùëâùëüùëíùëô
(
)
max (ùëÄ1 , ùëÄ2 ) 2

(O-1)

in which Vrel is the relative velocity between the two satellites, ùëÄ1 is the mass of the primary
satellite, and ùëÄ2 is the mass of the secondary satellite. When the relative kinetic energy exceeds
40,000 Joules per kilogram, ùúÄ‚àó , the collision is expected to be catastrophic and produce much
larger amounts of debris. The ODPO has further developed a relationship that estimates the
number of debris pieces greater than a specified size that the collision will generate:
ùêπùê∏ùëâ (ùëÄ1 , ùëÄ2 ) = {

0.1(ùëâùëüùëíùëô min(ùëÄ1 , ùëÄ2 ))0.75 ùêø‚àí1.71

ùêøùëê

if ùúÄ ‚â§ ùúÄ‚àó (noncatastrophic)
if ùúÄ > ùúÄ‚àó (catastrophic)

(O-2)

in which Lc is the characteristic length (size) above which one wishes to determine the number of
debris pieces. According to Lechtenberg and Hejduk (2019) and Lechtenberg (2019a),
‚Äútrackable‚Äù fragments are those with characteristic lengths exceeding a cutoff of ùêøùëê = 0.05 m. If
the collision is catastrophic, the number of fragments is determined by the sum of the two
satellites‚Äô masses; if it is non-catastrophic, the equation uses the product of the mass of the
lighter satellite and the conjunction‚Äôs relative velocity.
These relationships conform to first-order intuition regarding expected relative levels of debris
production. Any schoolboy who has played with dirt clods can testify that a greater relative
velocity between two conjuncting dirt clods will produce greater fragmentation. Furthermore, if
the masses of the heavier and lighter object differ substantially, which probably also means that
their relative sizes differ as well, one can imagine the (much) smaller object simply passing
through (cratering) the larger one and, while itself fragmenting, leaving the larger object
essentially intact. This full versus partial fragmentation division introduces a discontinuity in the
debris production relationship (as a function of relative mass and relative velocity), and the entire
dynamic, illustrated by Figure O-1, shows the extremely broad range of debris production
outcomes‚Äîfrom very few debris pieces to thousands‚Äîall of which represent real possibilities
for satellite conjunctions because the full range of secondary object mass values and relative
velocities shown in the figure are frequently encountered in practice.
To assess fragmentation risks a collision presents to the orbital environment, Hall and Baars
(2022) introduced a ‚Äúfragmentation probability‚Äù metric that measures a conjunction‚Äôs probability
of producing more than a threshold number of trackable fragments, ùêπ, given by:
ùëÉÃÖùêπ = ùîº[ùëÉùêπ (ùëÖ1 , ùëÖ2 , ùëÄ1 , ùëÄ2 )] ‚âà ùîº[ùëÉùëê (ùëÖ1 + ùëÖ2 ) √ó ùëà(ùêπùê∏ùëâ (ùëÄ1 , ùëÄ2 ) ‚àí ùêπ)]

(O-3)

where ùëÖ1 and ùëÖ2 are the primary and secondary object‚Äôs hard-body radii (HBR), respectively,
ùëà(‚àí) is the unit step function, and ùîº[‚àí] is the expectation value operator, which indicates the
expected results by averaging over all relevant random variables.

Figure O-1 Range of Debris Production Possibilities 19
Since the debris production potential can vary so greatly among different conjunctions, it makes
sense that conjunction remediation requirements should take cognizance of this parameter,
presuming of course that it can be estimated from available conjunction information. The
conjunction relative velocity is easy to calculate and is in fact provided directly as part of the
CDM, and the HBR and mass of the primary object are known by the satellite O/O. The HBR
and mass of the secondary object, however, are more elusive; in the great majority of
conjunctions, this object is a debris object for which there is no a priori information. One must
therefore look to estimation processes to estimate this object‚Äôs HBR and mass.
In formulating a HBR and mass estimation methodology, an approach is desired that is informed
by and accounts for associated uncertainties in the estimate. If conjunction mitigation
requirements are to be somewhat relaxed for low-debris-potential conjunctions, it is important to
err on the side of debris quantity overestimation to guarantee that all situations in which this
relaxed threshold may be applied are truly warranted. In nearly all practical cases, larger
secondary object HBR and mass values will result in larger produced debris counts. A
conservative approach requires ensuring, to a desired degree, that the estimation process
overestimate rather than underestimate the HBR and mass of the secondary object. Such an
orientation can be tuned and verified by attempting to estimate the HBR and mass of small
objects with known HBR and mass values such as microsats.

O.3 Estimating the Sizes of Unknown Objects
Stokely et al (2006) describe the NASA size estimation model (SEM), which provides a semiempirical method to convert radar cross-section (RCS) measurements for an unknown satellite
into a statistical ensemble of estimates for the ‚Äúcharacteristic length‚Äù of the object. Notably, this
characteristic length is not equivalent to the hard-body radius, but instead represents the average
of the largest dimensions of an object measured along three orthogonal axes, which corresponds
to the diameter for spherical objects. Applying the SEM to the nth RCS measurement available
for the jth satellite yields:

with ùê∑ùëó,ùëõ denoting the characteristic length (m) corresponding to the RCS measurement, ùúÜùëó,ùëõ the

radar wavelength (m), and ùëß = ùëåùëó,ùëõ /ùúÜùëó,ùëõ
, with ùëåùëó,ùëõ representing the measured RCS value (m2).
Stokley et al (2006) provide an interpolation table for the function ùëîùëÜùê∏ùëÄ (ùëß). Notably, the NASA
SEM provides no direct means to estimate the error or uncertainty of RCS-based characteristic
length estimates. This can be especially problematic if only one representative (e.g., median)
RCS value is available per satellite. As described in Hall and Baars (2022), numerous RCS
measurements are used per satellite over extended time periods (e.g., ~1,000 RCS measurements
acquired over ~2 years) to analyze the resulting characteristic length distributions to estimate
both the unknown hard-body radii and the associated uncertainties.
To start the HBR estimation process, Space Fence RCS data are collected for the two years prior
to the calibration epoch date. The analysis is restricted to objects with twenty or more well
calibrated and quality-curated Space Fence system RCS measurements, as described in detail by
Baars and Hall (2022). Next, the NASA SEM is used to estimate RCS-based characteristic length
estimates for each satellite, which typically have considerable point-to-point variability or
scatter. Sources of this scatter include the object‚Äôs aspect-dependent radar reflection properties
and projected area (which vary in time due to rotation and changing observational geometry), as
well as RCS measurement noise (which is often relatively minor). Empirical cumulative
distribution functions (CDFs) and probability density functions (PDFs) are generated from these
data.
Using the empirical PDF approximation, the mean characteristic length for the jth satellite is:

with ùëÅùëóùëÖùê∂ùëÜ indicating the number of RCS measurements for the jth satellite. Since the variable
radar reflection properties of a satellite causes some of the variation of the ùê∑ùëó,ùëõ values, the
empirical PDF approximation tends to overestimate the variance of the object‚Äôs actual
characteristic size distribution.
If the SEM were free of any estimation inaccuracies and the RCS measurements were free of any
measurement noise, then the relationship between the circumscribing HBR and the characteristic
length for idealized spherical objects would be relatively simple: ùëÖùëó = ùê∑ùëó /2. To quantify the bias
and uncertainty for noisy measurements of actual non-spherical objects, a calibration factor is
introduced into this relationship, expressed in either linear or logarithmic form as follows:
ùëÖùëó = Œ©ùëó (ùê∑ùëó /2) = ùëí ùúîùëó (ùê∑ùëó /2)

(O-7)

The formulation assumes that the calibration factors Œ©ùëó and ùúîùëó = log e (Œ©ùëó ) = ln(ùõ∫ùëó ) are time
invariant, but that they vary from satellite to satellite.
Hall and Baars (2022) uses a set of relatively small calibration satellites that all have convex
cuboid shapes. Specifically, the calibration analysis employs sizes obtained from the Database
and Information System Characterising Objects in Space (DISCOS), which tabulates the
bounding dimensions and general shape descriptions of a large number of known satellites.20 The
calibration analysis is restricted to satellites labeled as ‚Äúbox‚Äù shaped in the DISCOS database,
and that have no tabulated additional panels or attachments. The circumscribing HBR for a boxshaped satellite with sides of length ‚Ñíùëó , width ùí≤ùëó and height ‚Ñãùëó , is given by:

The calibration analysis is also restricted to DISCOS satellites with ùëÖùëóùêæ ‚â§ 0.35 m, which are
comparably small to the typical unknown debris objects involved in CARA conjunctions.
Space Fence observations collected in the two years preceding a calibration epoch date provide
usable RCS measurements of box-shaped satellites tabulated in the DISCOS database.21 Each of

Sivia and Skilling (2006) present a Bayesian analysis approach that can be used to estimate the
mean logarithmic calibration factor from the set {ùúîùëó , ùëó = 1 ‚Ä¶ ùêΩ}, with ùêΩ equal to the number of
selected calibration satellites from the DISCOS database which also have Space Fence RCS data.
The method assumes that satellite-to-satellite variations in the ùúîùëó values are Gaussiandistributed, and applies an uninformed-prior Bayesian analysis method to derive the maximum
posterior estimates for the mean calibration factor and variance:

Values for 586 Satellites 22
Figure O-2 compares the empirical CDF of the ratio of calibrated RCS-based HBR values to the
known values for the 586 satellites. The CDF indicates that, among this population, calibration
uncertainties limit the 95% confidence accuracy range of the HBR estimation process to within a
factor of 2.4 for potential underestimations, and to within a factor of 3.1 for potential
overestimations.

O.4 Estimating the Masses of Unknown Objects
Several approaches may be used to estimate the mass of an unknown object, the first involves the
use of the orbit determination-based ballistic coefficient (BC) estimate while the second uses the
orbit determination-based solar radiation pressure coefficient (SRPC) estimate. For satellites that
experience measurable atmospheric drag orbital perturbations, the BC estimation method is
preferred. However, for satellites with a perigee height above 450 km in altitude, the SRPC mass
estimates are somewhat more accurate.
O.4.1. RCS + Ballistic Coefficient Method
Combining RCS-based size estimates and orbit determination -based BC estimates provides a
means to estimate the masses of LEO satellites that experience measurable atmospheric drag.

This ‚ÄúRCS+BC‚Äù mass estimation method approximates the characteristic mass of a LEO satellite
using an expression formulated previously23:
‚Ñ≥ùê∑,ùëó = ùê¥ùëó ùêµùëó ùê∂ùê∑,ùëó ‚âà (ùúãùê∑ùëó2 /4)ùêµùëó ùê∂ùê∑,ùëó

(O-11)

In this expression, ‚Ñ≥ùê∑,ùëó indicates the mass that characterizes the atmospheric drag experienced
by the jth satellite, which is proportional to the product of the projected area, ùê¥ùëó , the inverse
ballistic coefficient, ùêµùëó , and the drag coefficient, ùê∂ùê∑,ùëó . The analysis uses RCS-based
characteristic projected areas to estimate satellite cross sectional areas projected normal to the
local atmospheric flow, ùê¥ùëó ‚âà (ùúãùê∑ùëó2 /4), which is a rough approximation, especially for highly
elongated or flattened objects. As before, a positive scalar calibration factor, Œ®ùëó , is introduced to
equation O-11 to quantify the bias and uncertainty of the RCS+BC mass estimation process:
ùëÄùëó ‚âà Œ®ùëó ‚Ñ≥ùê∑,ùëó = ùëí ùúìùëó [(ùúãùê∑ùëó2 /4)ùêµùëó ùê∂ùê∑,ùëó ]

(O-12)

with ùëÄùëó indicating the calibrated mass of the satellite, Œ®ùëó the linear calibration factor, and ùúìùëó the
logarithmic calibration factor. Again, the analysis assumes these calibration factors are time
invariant, but do vary from satellite to satellite. Applying equation O-12 to the jth calibration
satellite yields:
ÃÖ ]
ùëÄùëóùêæ = ùëí ùúìùëó ùîº[‚Ñ≥ùëó ] ‚âà ùëí ùúìùëó [ùê¥ùëóÃÖ ùêµÃÖùëó ùê∂ùê∑,ùëó

(O-13)

This approximation neglects correlations between the quantities ùê∑ùëó , ùêµùëó , and ùê∂ùê∑,ùëó . In order to use
equation O-13, the mean projected area, inverse ballistic coefficient, and drag coefficient will
need to be calculated for each satellite.
The mean projected area is approximated from the mean characteristic length and associated
variance:

ùê¥ùëóÃÖ = ùîº[ùê¥ùëó ] ‚âà ùúã (ùê∑
ùëó

(O-14)

The formulation approximates the inverse ballistic coefficient PDF, by first empirically
estimating the ballistic coefficient mean and variance parameters, and then assuming a lognormal
distribution of the form:
ùúå(ùêµùëó ) ‚âà

ùí© (ln(ùêµùëó ) , ùëèÃÖùëó , ùúéùëè2ùëó )

required for Monte Carlo estimations, cannot produce negative ùêµùëó values, which are physically
unrealistic for satellites that experience measurable levels of atmospheric drag. This unrealism is
why this analysis does not assume a PDF of the form ùí© (ùêµùëó , ùêµÃÖùëó , ùúéùêµ2ùëó ), which can potentially
produce negative sampled values.) The mean and variance of the inverse ballistic coefficient, ùêµÃÖùëó

and ùúéùêµ2ùëó , respectively, are estimated empirically by combining a set of orbit determination
solutions accumulated over the six months prior to the calibration epoch date. Specifically, the
analysis uses a series of orbit determination solutions separated by one week or more in time that
each represent an orbit determination solution for the jth satellite. The corresponding ballistic
coefficients, {(ùõΩùëó,ùëö , ŒîùõΩùëó,ùëö ), ùëö = 1 ‚Ä¶ ùëÅùëóùëâùê∂ùëÄ }, typically number ùëÅùëóùëâùê∂ùëÄ ‚âà 25 for most satellites.
The ballistic coefficients, ùõΩùëó,ùëö , and associated 1-sigma orbit determination estimation
uncertainties, ŒîùõΩùëó,ùëö , are then combined using a weighted averaging scheme. The first step in the
process is to calculate the inverse ballistic coefficient and uncertainty for the mth Vector

Œíùëó,ùëö = 1/ùõΩùëó,ùëö and ŒîŒíùëó,ùëö = ŒîùõΩùëó,ùëö /ùõΩùëó,ùëö

O.4.2. RCS + Solar Radiation Pressure Coefficient Method
Combining RCS-based size estimates and orbit determination-based solar radiation pressure
coefficient estimates provides a means to estimate the masses of satellites that experience
measurable solar radiation pressure (SRP) perturbations. This ‚ÄúRCS+SRPC‚Äù mass estimation
analysis approximates the characteristic mass of a LEO satellite using an expression similar in
form to that used for RCS+BC based mass estimation given by equation O-11:
‚Ñ≥ùëÖ,ùëó ‚âà (ùúãùê∑ùëó2 /4)ùê∫ùëó ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëó

(O-22)

In this expression, ‚Ñ≥ùëÖ,ùëó indicates the mass that characterizes SRP perturbations experienced by
the jth satellite, which is proportional to the product of three quantities: the area projected
towards the incident sunlight (again approximated using ùúãùê∑ùëó2 /4), the inverse solar radiation
pressure coefficient, ùê∫ùëó , and the reflectivity coefficient, ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëó . See Vallado (2001) for more details
on orbital SRP perturbations. As before, this study introduces a positive scalar calibration factor,
Œòùëó , into equation O-22 to quantify the bias and uncertainty of the RCS+SRPC mass estimation
process:
ùëÄùëó ‚âà Œòùëó ‚Ñ≥ùëÖ,ùëó = ùëí ùúÉùëó [(ùúãùê∑ùëó2 /4)ùê∫ùëó ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëó ]

(O-23)

with ùëÄùëó indicating the calibrated mass of the satellite, Œòùëó the linear calibration factor, and ùúÉùëó the
logarithmic calibration factor. The process of estimating the calibration factors for the
RCS+SRPC mass estimation process uses the same exact analysis steps as outlined in the
previous section for the RCS+BC mass estimation process but substitutes the orbit
determination-based inverse solar radiation pressure coefficient, ùê∫ùëó , for the inverse ballistic
coefficient, ùêµùëó , and also substitutes the reflectivity coefficient, ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëó , for the drag coefficient, ùê∂ùê∑,ùëó .
The analysis assumes a uniform PDF with bounds ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëöùëñùëõ = 1 and ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëöùëéùë• = 1.4 for all satellites,
ÃÖ = 1.2, and variance ùúéùê∂2 = 0.013 (i.e., ùúéùê∂ = 0.12). The lower
which yields a mean of ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëó
ùëÖ,ùëó
ùëÖ,ùëó
bound of ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëöùëñùëõ = 1 corresponds to that expected for dark bodies (i.e., that have negligible
overall reflectance) of any shape. The upper bound of ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëöùëéùë• = 1.4 represents the theoretical
value for a Lambertian sphere with 90% reflectance,26 and is assumed to provide a reasonable
upper limit for unknown secondary objects.
The analysis restricts RCS+SRPC mass estimation to satellites with perigee altitudes above 450
km altitude to ensure that imperfectly modeled atmospheric drag perturbations do not bias the
solar radiation pressure coefficients estimated in the orbit determination analysis, which has been
observed to occur for LEO satellites at lower altitudes. For the calibration epoch date of 202201-15, sufficient RCS data and VCM SRPC estimates are available for ùêΩ = 303 of the DISCOS
cuboid satellites with perigees above 450 km altitude. The calibration analysis yields ùúÉÃÖ = 0.173
and ùúéùúÉ = 0.884.

Figure O-4 CDF of the Ratio of Calibrated RCS+SRPC Mass Estimates to
Known Masses for 303 Satellites 27
Figure O-4 compares the empirical CDF of the ratio of calibrated mass estimates to the known
values for the 303 satellites. The CDF indicates that, among this population, calibration
uncertainties limit the 95% confidence accuracy range of the RCS+SRPC mass estimation
process to within a factor of 3.8 for potential mass underestimations, and to within a factor of 8.4
for potential mass overestimations. This means that, for satellites with perigee altitudes above
450 km, the RCS+SRPC method provides somewhat more accurate mass estimates than the
RCS+BC estimation method, although both methods provide rough mass estimates overall.

O.5. The Probability of Exceeding a Threshold Number of Trackable
Fragments
Recall equation O-3 that defines a fragmentation probability metric, which is calculated using an
expectation value to determine the probability that a conjunction will generate more than a
threshold number of trackable fragments. For known-on-unknown conjunctions, calculating this
expectation value represents integrating over a set of five random variables that account for the
size and mass estimation uncertainties of the secondary object. Specifically, for the RCS+BC
mass estimation method, these five random variables are {ùê∑2 , ùúî2 , ùúì2 , ùêµ2 , ùê∂ùê∑,2 }; for RCS+SRPC
mass estimation they are {ùê∑2 , ùúî2 , ùúÉ2 , ùê∫2 , ùê∂ùëÖ,2 }. Correspondingly, unknown-on-unknown
collisions require integrations over ten random variables associated with both objects. In other
words, estimating the statistically expected fragmentation probability, ùëÉÃÖùêπ , entails evaluating
either a 5-D or 10-D integral. The integrand function of these multi-dimensional integrals
contains the product of the conjunction‚Äôs collision probability, ùëÉùëê (ùëÖ1 + ùëÖ2 ), and the binary
probability that the number of fragments, ùêπùê∏ùëâ (ùëÄ1 , ùëÄ2 ), exceeds the threshold value, ùêπ. Both of
these functions are non-linear, and the latter possesses discontinuities. The Monte Carlo method
provides and efficient and straightforward means of computing such multi-dimensional integrals.

From Hall and Baars (2022)

Appendix O. Collision Consequence

173

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Focusing on the known-on-unknown collision case for the RCS+BC mass estimation method, the
five random variables are computed as follows:
1. ùê∑2 is modeled as a normally distributed variable using the mean and variance defined in
equations O-5 and O-6.
2. ùúî2 is modeled as a normally distributed variable using the mean and variance defined in
equation O-10.
3. ùúì2 is modeled as a normally distributed variable using the mean and variance defined in
equation O-21.
4. ùêµ2 is modeled as a normally distributed variable in logarithmic space using the mean and
variance defined directly below equation O-15.
5. ùê∂ùê∑,2 is modeled as a uniformly distributed variable with ùê∂ùê∑,ùëöùëñùëõ = 2.1 and ùê∂ùê∑,ùëöùëéùë• = 2.9.
The RCS+SRPC mass estimation method uses the same computations for ùê∑2 and ùúî2 . For the
remaining variables, ùúì2 is replaced with ùúÉ2 , ùêµ2 is replaced with ùê∫2 , and ùê∂ùê∑,2 is replaced with
ùê∂ùëÖ,2 (along with the associated ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëöùëñùëõ and ùê∂ùëÖ,ùëöùëéùë• values).
In the Monte Carlo method these random variables are used to generate a set of ùëÖ2 and ùëÄ2
values for a number of Monte Carlo trials, ùëÅùëÄùê∂ . The fragmentation probability is then estimated
as:
ùëÅùëÄùê∂

ùëÉÃÖùêπ ‚âà
‚àë [ùëÉùëê (ùëÖ1 + ùëÖ2,ùëõ ) √ó ùëà(ùêπùê∏ùëâ (ùëÄ1 , ùëÄ2,ùëõ ) ‚àí ùêπ)]
ùëÅùëÄùê∂

(O-24)

ùëõ=1

For ùêπ = 0, it is straightforward to show that ùëÉÃÖùêπ = ùëÉÃÖùëê . More generally, a conjunction‚Äôs
fragmentation probability cannot exceed the collision probability, ùëÉÃÖùêπ ‚â§ ùëÉÃÖùëê . For groups like
CARA that use the collision probability to assess close approach risks, this inequality property
makes ùëÉÃÖùêπ a convenient choice to assess environmental risks, for two reasons. First, if the
screening process indicates that ùëÉÃÖùëê is less than a negligibly small green-level cutoff (i.e., 10‚àí10),
then ùëÉÃÖùêπ also must be less than that cutoff. Second, the inequality implies that all conjunctions
that represent red-level environmental risks (i.e., those with ùëÉÃÖùêπ ‚â• 10‚àí4 ) are naturally contained
within the set of conjunctions identified as red-level risks (i.e., those with ùëÉÃÖùëê ‚â• 10‚àí4 ).
To demonstrate how collision and fragmentation probabilities can be used together, a threshold
of ùêπ = 103 was used to assess an unacceptably high level of risk to the orbital environment.
Figure O-5 compares fragmentation and collision probabilities for known-on-unknown CARA
conjunctions, calculated using this fragment production threshold. Among the conjunctions
analyzed, 1,734 represent red-level close approach risks with ùëÉÃÖùëê ‚â• 10‚àí4 . Among these, 122 (or
7%) also have ùëÉÃÖùêπ ‚â• 10‚àí4, so they represent red-level environmental risks as well. Figure O-5
plots these dual high-risk conjunctions as red stars, illustrating how collision and fragmentation
probabilities can be used together to identify the subset of events with the highest spacecraft and
environmental risks. Pink diamonds and triangles represent conjunctions with red-level close
approach risks, but lower environmental risks.

Figure O-5 Collision and Fragmentation Probabilities for Known-onUnknown Conjunctions 28
As discussed above, a fragment production threshold of ùêπ = 103 indicates that 7% of the
analyzed known-on-unknown conjunctions with ùëÉÃÖùëê ‚â• 10‚àí4 also have ùëÉÃÖùêπ ‚â• 10‚àí4 . This analysis
uses ùêπ = 103 as a threshold number of trackable fragments because such a collision would
potentially represent a major source of LEO debris generation, comparable to the IridiumCosmos collision in 2009 which produced about 1,200 trackable fragments that remained in
Earth orbit for longer than one year. Other production thresholds provide different assessments
of environmental risk in a non-linear fashion. For instance, about 20% of the studied
conjunctions have ùëÉÃÖùêπ ‚â• 10‚àí4 for the somewhat more moderate threshold of ùêπ = 102 . So,
considering the range of 102 ‚â§ ùêπ ‚â§ 103 indicates that 5% to 20% of the high mission risk
conjunctions also could be assessed to pose an elevated risk to the orbital environment.
It must be emphasized that no O/O would be asked to take advantage of the low-debrisproducing-event possibility for relaxed mitigation requirements. Whether to focus on the
protection of their own payload or merely to take a more conservative posture generally,
missions certainly may embrace the 10‚àí4 Pc threshold for all conjunctions. From an orbit regime
protection point of view, however, it would not be unreasonable to relax this threshold mildly for
situations that are non-catastrophic and only expected to create a small amount of debris,
especially in the presence of other relevant considerations, such as the inability to identify a truly
adequate mitigation action that did not impose non-trivial mission compromise. The use of
fragmentation propensity may also be desirable for triage situations in which a mission is
experiencing more serious conjunctions than it is possible to remediate. In such cases, one could
direct mitigation focus to those conjunctions that hold the greatest debris production potential.

Appendix P. Event Actionability
P.1 Introduction
Although widely used, the term ‚Äúconjunction event actionability‚Äù is a somewhat unfortunate
term because it implies a broader scope than it merits. Its precise meaning is the assessment of
the propagated state and state uncertainty information for the two satellites in conjunction (but
with the focus usually on the secondary object) to determine whether these data constitute a
reasonable basis for conjunction risk assessment and mitigation actions. It does not include the
further step of deciding, in the presence of a high-risk situation, whether the mitigation actions
are excessively invasive or detrimental to the mission‚Äôs objectives to warrant their being set aside
despite the collision risk; that is, whether an O/O would be justified in refraining from taking
‚Äúaction‚Äù to mitigate the conjunction and lessen the collision risk because of the mission impact
of the mitigation action. This latter consideration is real and constitutes part of the risk
assessment process, but one arrives at this decision point only after determining that the orbital
data feeding the analysis are durable and thus are enabling credible collision risk calculations.
The propriety of considering the quality of the event‚Äôs input orbital data is obvious because an
O/O will certainly wish to certify that the collision risk is truly high and that a proposed
mitigation action will remediate the collision risk before considering its actual execution. The
desire for a conservative risk approach does not make the problem simpler. If the input
astrodynamics data are questionable, it is also questionable whether any proposed mitigation
action will actually improve the situation because such an action could in fact make the situation
worse. So it is not appropriate simply to say that situations of questionable data quality should,
out of conservatism, be afforded such actions if the calculated risk parameters exceed the
threshold for mitigation actions. Rather, it is necessary to establish a method for identifying those
cases in which the input data may be sufficiently poor to make meaningful risk assessment
impossible.
It is important to recognize that the question to be addressed here is whether the orbital data
properly represent the two objects‚Äô states and uncertainties and not whether the associated
uncertainties are large or ‚Äútoo large.‚Äù If one embraces Pc as the principal (but not necessarily the
sole) collision likelihood assessment metric, excessively large covariances have the effect of
depressing the Pc value and thus giving a (much) lower statement of risk. This particular
phenomenon, called the ‚Äúdilution region‚Äù situation, is a known peculiarity of Pc and is discussed
at some length in Appendix M, but there is general agreement that high Pc values do represent
situations of high collision likelihood. In such situations, the fact that covariances may seem
excessively large should not constitute an impediment to event actionability. If, despite a
somewhat tracking-data-impoverished situation (hence the large covariance), a worrisome Pc is
still produced, a fortiori the situation should be treated as serious and worthy of mitigation.
This area of conjunction risk assessment‚Äîthe determination of event actionability‚Äîpossesses
the least precision in terms of clear, documentable standards. The certification of orbitdetermination updates as valid and reasonable and propagation intervals and methods as
sufficiently representative is, in the end, rendered not through conformity to strict, fully
Appendix P. Event Actionability

176

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance

articulated rules but rather through the judgment of expert orbital analysts who have personally
performed thousands of orbit-determination updates and propagations. Astrodynamics is often at
least as much an art as a science, and batch orbit-determination update particularly so. To be
sure, most of the cases that are actually encountered in conjunction assessment practice can be
judged to be valid and acceptable through rule conformity alone, and there are certain cases that
are so poor that there is little difficulty in recognizing their invalidity immediately. But there is
also a relatively small input data group that cannot be directly assigned to either of these
resolutions, and it is here that expert opinion is required.
There are two separate aspects of the astrodynamics input data to consider: the states and
covariances for the primary and secondary objects at epoch as outputs of the orbit-determination
process, and the states and covariances propagated forward to TCA. These two aspects will be
treated separately below, with the concluding section outlining how considerations from each are
combined into a judgment of actionability/non-actionability for a particular event. Some of the
threshold values for the actual parameters used in the tests to be described below are placed in an
annex to this appendix, both for ease of reading and to allow easier document update should
these values be modified. Finally, while it is the case that in principle a judgment of the
suitability of the primary object‚Äôs state and covariance is required as part of the overall
actionability assessment, in practice it is almost always the secondary object‚Äôs data quality that is
an issue. To simplify the treatment, the following discussion will frequently frame the discussion
in terms of a single object that can be presumed to be the secondary.

P.2 Evaluation of the Propriety of the Orbit-Determination Fit
It should be obvious that a quality orbit-determination fit for the object is a foundational element
in any use of its state and uncertainty data. If the fit itself is questionable, it is difficult to have
confidence in any astrodynamics products propagated forward from it. Because the
USSPACECOM catalog is at present usually the sole supplier for all data on the secondary
object (especially in the case of debris objects with a small radar cross section value) and also
provides solutions for the primary object, the focus has to be placed on the orbit-determination fit
mechanism used for this catalog, which is not a sequential estimator but a minimum-variance
batch process. This means that in addition to the force model settings for the dynamical models,
the time-span of the tracking data for the fit, data density, tracking data sensor composition, and
retention of the sensor data used in each batch update have to be considered. If a different data
provider for orbital information about the secondary object were to be used, a set of orbitdetermination quality criteria tailored to that particular provider‚Äôs orbit-determination
methodology and engine would need to be developed and consulted. The remainder of this
section can be seen as a proposed template for how that development and consultation might
proceed.
If it were possible to generate hard-and-fast rules for determining the control settings and data
handling for these batch updates, the assessment of fit acceptability would be much more
straightforward. Despite decades of attempts, astrodynamics specialists for DOD have concluded
that such a rule set is simply not possible, especially when densely-packed debris clouds are
considered. The only way truly to evaluate the propriety of an orbit-determination fit is a manual
Appendix P. Event Actionability

177

review by an expert. This individual has access to information of the full suite of input sensor
raw and ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù data including:
‚Ä¢

Tables of residuals,

‚Ä¢

Residual plots in a variety of different constructions and the ability to edit out individual
observables,

‚Ä¢

Before-and-after values of key orbital elements in the context of long-term plots to
evaluate trends, and

‚Ä¢

The ability to attempt multiple corrections with different force-model settings and data
contents to evaluate the results comparatively and choose the best outcome.

Such evaluations, most of them visual, simply cannot be replaced by rules themselves.
However, what is possible is to provide a set of guidelines that, if violated, would typically
prompt a manual review by an expert. Within a NASA or USSPACECOM context, an expert
could be summoned and, with access to the data products enumerated in the above paragraph,
could render an expert opinion on the propriety of the orbit determination. Outside of these
agencies, such data access is not available. Nonetheless, the rule set can be useful; for example,
orbit-determination results that do conform to all of the general rules can, with a high degree of
confidence, be accepted as a basis for conjunction risk assessment.
The following subparagraphs describe the particular orbit-determination input summaries,
settings, and quality factors evaluated by the rule set, and the annex to this appendix gives
threshold values that allow for the evaluation of an orbit determination‚Äôs conformity to these
rules. All the information needed to evaluate a particular orbit determination is present in the
CDM.

P.3 Force Model Settings and Non-Conservative Force Model
Parameter Values
Any space catalog has at its core a set of astrodynamics dynamical models that are used to
predict the trajectories of space objects, and the orbit-determination process determines
parameter values to use within these models to predict future positions of a particular satellite.
Different physical phenomena and their effects on satellites are modeled, and for some of these
models, varying levels of fidelity can be selected. The following paragraphs list each of the
selectable force models that can be applied, identify the selection criteria, and give some
indication of parameters and parameter values that might lead one to question the propriety of an
orbit determination.
1. Geopotential. Two-body motion, the simplest of possible orbit solutions, is the
foundation of the astrodynamics model set. The first major improvement in precision is
the recognition that the Earth is not a uniform and uniformly dense sphere but varies from
this idealization in many ways. A spherical harmonic representation of the actual
geopotential is used to represent the Earth‚Äôs bulge at the equator and other density nonuniformities; the spherical harmonic order is specified as part of the correction. The
minimum required geopotential order (in terms of zonals and tesserals) for an acceptable
Appendix P. Event Actionability

178

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
fit is determined by considering characteristics of the satellite‚Äôs orbit, and any orbitdetermination update that uses a geopotential order lower (smaller) than this specified
value is flagged for manual review. The actual minimum geopotential order thresholds as
a function of orbital parameters are given in the annex to this appendix.
2. Lunar-Solar Perturbations. While the Earth is obviously the most significant central
attracting body for a satellite, the sun and moon are large enough to visit a non-negligible
effect on a satellite‚Äôs orbit. For precision solutions, this modeling (called ‚Äúthird-body
effects‚Äù) should always be engaged.
3. Solid Earth Tides. The gravitational force of the moon deforms the quasi-spherical
Earth, and this deformity changes the geopotential and satellite orbits. Often, the effect is
small and unlikely to alter conjunction assessment results. Because it is not
computationally difficult to characterize, it is standard practice to include this modeling
input in precision solutions. In the main, however, it is unlikely that the failure to include
this perturbation would make the resultant orbit determination questionable from a
conjunction assessment perspective although it could alter the results observably.
4. Atmospheric Drag. The major non-conservative force affecting many LEO orbits is
atmospheric drag. The modeling of drag acceleration is a function of the satellite‚Äôs
velocity relative to the atmosphere, the atmospheric density, and the satellite‚Äôs ballistic
coefficient, which itself is a combination of the coefficient of drag, the satellite‚Äôs frontal
area, and its mass. Because for most satellites, especially debris objects, neither the drag
coefficient nor the frontal area nor the mass is known, the entire ballistic coefficient is
treated as a single solved-for parameter as part of the orbit determination. Certain LEO
orbits should include atmospheric drag modeling and solutions for the ballistic
coefficient, and for those that do, there are ranges of reasonable solutions for this solvedfor parameter. The annex to this appendix delineates the LEO orbits that require a drag
solution and the ranges of acceptable ballistic coefficient values.
5. Solar Radiation Pressure. While electromagnetic radiation has no mass, it does impart
momentum, and the momentum carried by the sun‚Äôs energy and incident upon the
satellite has a discernable effect on the resultant orbit. The USSPACECOM dynamical
model set employs a standard solar radiation pressure model (SRP), which is a function
of a solar radiation pressure coefficient (SRPC) (analogous to the ballistic coefficient)
and a scalar and vector distance to the sun. Certain orbits should have the solar radiation
pressure model enabled, and for these there are acceptable ranges of values for the solar
radiation pressure coefficient. The relevant orbits for solar radiation pressure
compensation and the associated ranges of values for the coefficient are given in the
annex to this appendix.

P.4 Orbit Determination Fit Span (or Length of Update Interval)
Sequential estimators process each measurement individually, usually as each is received; batch
estimators collect a ‚Äúbatch‚Äù of measurements and process them as a group. When using batch
estimation, it is necessary to identify the particular group of measurement data to be fit, which
usually means determining the period back in time from the present for retrieval of data to use in
Appendix P. Event Actionability

179

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
an update. While this activity may at first not seem important, in fact it can greatly affect the
quality of the resultant orbit determination. If the data period is too long, the prediction error
from the orbit-determination fit state is increased; if the data period is too short, a robust drag or
solar radiation pressure solution is not possible; and if there are too few measurements contained
within the span, the solution is not reliably representative.
To set the data interval and density correctly, the USSPACECOM batch update process employs
a complicated algorithm called the Dynamic Length of Update Interval (LUPI) Assignment
(DLA) to examine the measurement data history for each fit and assign the proper LUPI to strike
an acceptable balance between maximizing prediction accuracy and ensuring a reasonable
solution for the non-conservative force parameters (drag and solar radiation pressure). The
algorithm operates by beginning with the maximum acceptable LUPI for a particular orbit and
attempting to minimize it while preserving sufficient observational data to endure a quality
update, and if the maximum LUPI itself does not encompass enough tracking data, the algorithm
will expand past this theoretical maximum value to attempt to bring more data into the
correction. The goal of this approach is to provide quality updates most of the time and
serviceable updates all the time, with ‚Äúserviceable‚Äù defined here as sufficient to allow sensor
reacquisition of the satellite. Updates that are merely serviceable are, however, not in themselves
of sufficient quality for conjunction risk assessment. Also worrisome are LUPI lengths shorter
than the default minimum, which occur when large amounts of measurement data are eliminated
from a satellite‚Äôs history (due, for example, to a satellite maneuver after which the old
observational data have to be thrown away because they no longer represent the satellite‚Äôs
current trajectory). While a subject matter expert could, with broader data access, perhaps certify
some of these results as acceptable for conjunction risk assessment, as a general rule, orbit
determinations with LUPI lengths that are either longer than the theoretical maximum or shorter
than the theoretical minimum cannot produce reliable state updates and reliable covariances and
thus cannot serve as a basis for conjunction risk assessment.
A table of these maximum and minimum lengths is given in the annex to this appendix.

P.5 Residual Acceptance
The batch solution generates an optimal solution by minimizing the sum-of-squares residual of
the data chosen for the fit; therefore, large residuals against individual observables affect the
fitting process substantially. Because it is not uncommon to receive ‚Äúbad‚Äù measurement data
from sensors, a stratagem has been implemented to limit the overall effect of potentially errant
data: between iterations of the non-linear regressive solver, the measurement residuals against
the provisional solution are examined, and data points that manifest excessively large residuals
are eliminated. This allows the fit to proceed without being influenced disproportionately by only
a few measurements.
The elimination of measurement data in a data-fitting context merely because they appear to
encumber a more satisfactory fit is always somewhat disconcerting as most numerical analysts
discourage the elimination of any given datum without some a priori reason to suspect that it
may be errant. However, incidences of satellite cross-tagging (in which the assignment of data to
the correct satellite miscarries by the data being assigned to some other, usually nearby satellite)
Appendix P. Event Actionability

180

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
are frequent enough that some provision has to be made for eliminating sensor observations that
simply do not seem consistent with the rest of a satellite‚Äôs measurement data. There are also
situations in which data mismatches are overtly recognized, such as after a satellite maneuver,
because the trajectory has changed impulsively and observational data before the maneuver do
not represent the current trajectory and have to be eliminated intentionally.
If too much of the measurement information is eliminated, the concern is that the fit may not be
properly representative. Therefore, when the percent of the residuals eliminated exceeds a certain
value, the fit merits manual review. A table of these values is given in the annex to this appendix.

P.6 Weighted Root-Mean-Square of Residuals
It is common when performing an iterative batch fit to use the root-mean-square of the residuals
as an indication of fit quality, tracking this value to ensure that the fit is improving with each
iteration. For an unweighted root-mean-square, the ideal value would be zero as it would indicate
that the model fits the data exactly without any residual error. For the USSPACECOM
minimum-variance batch solver, a weighted root-mean-square is used (WRMS), in which the
square of each residual is divided by the variance of the a priori expected error for that
observable type (e.g., range to target, azimuth angle, elevation angle) from that particular sensor
as established by a sensor calibration process separate from the orbit-determination activity. If
the residual errors and actual sensor errors are Gaussian, then the average of these ratios should
equal unity (as will its square root). The weighted root-mean-square is a better measurement of
fit error because the best reasonable expected outcome is that the error of the fit will be of
essentially the same magnitude as the inherent error in the observations.
If the fit‚Äôs weighted root-mean-square is too large, then the fit is not particularly convincing, and
manual review would generally be counselled. A weighted root-mean-square value less than
unity, while not necessarily bad, nonetheless would also warrant a manual review: while a fit of a
higher quality than the inherent error in the observations is possible, it is usually a result of too
few data in the orbit determination and therefore should be investigated. Thresholds for
excessively high weighted root-mean-square are set by object type and given in the annex to this
appendix.

P.7 Default Covariance
The DOD precision orbit-determination solution produces an estimation error covariance as a
regular product. There are situations, however, in which the automatic precision orbitdetermination solution cannot be made to converge, and in such cases, the system executes a
general perturbations analytic orbit-determination solution, employing the same theory used to
produce TLEs. This process as presently designed produces a state (although an inaccurate one
with 1-2 km of expected error in LEO) but no covariance, and this is indicated by providing a
diagonal covariance for which the diagonal elements for the position portion are each ten Earth
radii.
General perturbation solutions are not sufficiently accurate to serve as a basis for conjunction
mitigation actions, so if one of these default covariances is encountered, the state data that
accompany it are not suitable for conjunction risk assessment.
Appendix P. Event Actionability

P.8 Review Process
As stated above, if the full orbit-determination data are present and a subject matter expert is
available to render an expert opinion, situations in which the general rules given above are
violated can be investigated and an adjudication obtained. If this level of access is not available,
the above rules can serve as a one-sided test; namely, if the current orbit determination conforms
to all of the rules, then it can be presumed that the orbit determination is durable and can serve as
a basis for conjunction risk assessment and, if necessary, mitigation action planning.

P.9 Evaluation of Propagation from Epoch to TCA
Most conjunction risk assessment approaches make assessments using the states and covariances
of the primary and secondary objects propagated to TCA, so in addition to considering the
propriety of the orbit-determination fits themselves, one also has to consider whether any issues
with the propagation itself might make the TCA products unsuitable for conducting risk
assessment. Issues related to propagation are often called out as potentially problematic, and a
treatment of each of these is given in this section. But the overall conclusion is that the
USSPACECOM approach to producing astrodynamics products at TCA is robust and contains
mechanisms to address the major sources of expected propagation error, and these can be
augmented with additional processes within risk assessment. As such, if an orbit determination
sustains the criteria for an acceptable fit, it can be presumed that this fit propagated to TCA
renders a state and covariance acceptable for conjunction risk assessment, except in a few narrow
instances called out below.

P.9.1 Propagated Covariance is Defective
In some situations, the propagated covariance can be defective to the degree that it cannot be
used as presented for conjunction risk assessment.
1. Null Covariances. The first is a null covariance in which all the entries are zeroes. This
is the equivalent of not having a covariance at all, and when described in the previous
section that addressed orbit-determination fit results, it was pointed out that situations
with such a covariance cannot be used for conjunction risk assessment. If there is no
covariance at epoch, there cannot be a propagated covariance at TCA either, so such a
situation can be considered to be inactionable. It is possible to use maximalist techniques
such as those developed by Alfano (2005b) and by Frisbee (2015) to proceed in situations
in which only one of the two objects has a covariance, but these techniques are
exceedingly conservative and therefore not recommended as a routinely used proxy for
collision likelihood.
2. Default Covariances. The second is a default covariance in which the presence of
diagonal elements of ten Earth radii indicates a general perturbation solution that
produced no covariance. While in principle this covariance can be propagated to TCA, it
will essentially be an ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù covariance at TCA‚Äîjust as it was at epoch‚Äîand
therefore force any calculated Pc to zero (and sometimes introduce convergence
problems in Pc calculation routines). Situations such as this can be judged to be nonactionable (because the covariance for one of the objects cannot be established) or
Appendix P. Event Actionability

182

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
produce in every case a Pc of zero (because this is what very large covariances do).
Embracing either possibility leads to the same conclusion of not requiring a mitigation
action.
3. Non-Positive-Semidefinite Covariances. The third is for the TCA covariance to become
non-positive-semidefinite. This issue is addressed at greater length elsewhere (Hall et al.
2017b), and the takeaway from that discussion is that the problem arises due to truncation
and interpolation errors (not fundamental problems with the orbit determination) and can
be straightforwardly repaired. The article recommends certain repair techniques, and the
source code for them is provided on the NASA CARA software repository. (See Section
7, Contact Information in this document for the specific URL.) A modification to the
USSPACECOM operational system has been implemented that should essentially
eliminate non-positive-semidefinite situations.
Of the mainstream direct defects in TCA covariances, null and default covariances do produce
situations that result in inactionability; non-positive-semidefinite covariances do not.

P.9.2 Excessive Propagation Interval to Retain Gaussian Covariance
Behavior
The astrodynamics discipline has had to address the question of Gaussian uncertainty volumes
and the difficulties introduced by the Cartesian framework‚Äôs inability fully to represent
curvilinearly produced results. As discussed at greater length in Appendix N, while this debate
continues in the critical literature, the conjunction assessment enterprise has been able largely to
set it aside by recognizing that the issue is not really relevant to high-Pc events because of the
amount of overlap of the ‚Äúmain‚Äù portions of the covariance necessary to produce a high Pc.
Furthermore, the issue can be remediated easily by performing Monte Carlo from TCA with the
random sampling conducted from the equinoctial representation of the covariance. While much
has been made in the literature of the problem of non-Gaussian covariances for conjunction
assessment, based on NASA CARA‚Äôs analysis, this problem is not crippling for the categories of
events that actually matter to conjunction risk assessment, and in any case, it can be addressed
with a particular Pc calculation technique that is both straightforward and tractable.

P.9.3 Excessive Propagation Interval Due to a Lack of Tracking Data
The USSPACECOM orbit-determination process places the epoch time of its orbit-determination
fits at the time of the last observation. Since this is the time at which the fitted results are
modeled, any propagation into the future takes place from that time. Because this orbit
determination is used as the most current update until more tracking data are received and a new
update executed, to propagate the state and covariance to TCA usually involves two stages: to
propagate forward from the epoch time to the current time, and then to propagate from the
current time forward to TCA. If no new tracking data are received for some time, then a quite
long propagation of the original orbit-determination state may be required. For example, if the
object has not been tracked for five days and TCA is three days from the present time, a total of
eight days‚Äô propagation is required to produce the state and covariance at TCA.

Appendix P. Event Actionability

183

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
It is best if tracking data are received frequently because this produces better data density for the
fit and reduces the overall amount of propagation time. There is nothing about long propagation
times per se that indicts the utility of the resultant products; as the propagation proceeds, the
uncertainties in the propagated covariance grow appropriately to represent the expected
uncertainties of the states at the propagation termination, which is here TCA. Additionally,
adjustments to the covariance to account for atmospheric density forecast error and satellite
frontal area uncertainty are included and contribute to the propagated covariance‚Äôs growth
(discussed in Appendix N). Finally, a large covariance matrix will in most cases depress the
calculated Pc value, naturally correcting for a situation in which the state uncertainties are so
large that it may not be comfortable to use them as a basis of action. Given this dynamic, the lack
of recent tracking data invalidates neither the original fit (presuming there was sufficient tracking
in the fit-span to produce an acceptable fit) nor the propagation to TCA.
Nonetheless, a rule of thumb that has been used over the last few decades for orbit-determination
batch updates is that the propagation interval should not be longer than the fit-span/LUPI. It is
generally considered dangerous to try to propagate longer than the span of measurement data that
directed the orbit-determination update. While there are undoubtedly situations in which
propagations of this type could still be representative, it is believed that the reasonable span of
the orbit determination has been exceeded in such a case, and it is thus reasonable to refrain from
any mitigation action for conjunctions for which either object‚Äôs orbit determination at TCA was
generated with so extended a propagation interval.

P.9.4 Excessive Atmospheric Density Error Due to Solar Storms
As explained in Appendix N, for some years, the USSPACECOM orbit-determination process
has adjusted the covariance in the CDM for anticipated atmospheric density forecast error
through the application of a consider parameter. The Jacchia-Bowman-HASDM 2009 (JBH09)
atmospheric density model used by USSPACECOM contains special functionality to reduce
propagation error in the presence of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), a commonly encountered
type of solar storm. A special model given the name ‚ÄúAnemomilos‚Äù attempts to predict the size,
time of arrival, and geoeffectiveness of CMEs, and the atmospheric density is modified
appropriately during the prediction interval to reflect the storm‚Äôs predicted arrival and effects.
(Tobiska et al. 2013) Paired with the appropriate consider parameter value, which will
compensate for the expected uncertainty in this type of modeling, the predicted product should in
principle account for atmospheric density mismodeling. The fact that the solar environment is
perturbed should not, therefore, result in an a priori conclusion that the predictions of an event‚Äôs
severity are errant and that a claim of event inactionability is appropriate. Having said that, it is
also the case that the performance of the Anemomilos model during the most recent solar cycle
(solar cycle 25) has been disappointing: normed on data from earlier solar cycles, the model is
not producing representative results presently. A number of different mitigation activities are
presently being considered, including simply turning off this particular modeling feature.
Unfortunately, it is not possible during regular operations to determine the degree to which
Anemomilos is affecting prediction outcomes, although this model will engage only when the
predicted Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) parameter value is smaller than -75nanoTeslas, so one
can consult space weather predictions to determine whether there is any possibility of the
Appendix P. Event Actionability

184

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
model‚Äôs being employed. This general issue is addressed at greater length in the walk-through of
a sample event in Appendix Q.
Some additional insight into such situations can be gained by constructing what are called Space
Weather Trade Space (SWTS) plots that explore how the collision likelihood of a particular
event would change if the atmospheric density were mismodeled. Because atmospheric density
and ballistic coefficient are multiplicatively coupled in the atmospheric drag acceleration
equation, changing one of these parameters has the same effect as changing the other. It is thus
possible to vary the primary and secondary objects‚Äô drag parameters to understand the effect of
drag modeling on the event‚Äôs conjunction likelihood.
The plots are constructed by varying the nominal ballistic coefficient by half an order of
magnitude in each direction with the x-axis giving the primary object ballistic coefficient
variation, the y-axis that for the secondary object, and the color indicating the resultant Pc value.
However, these details are not so important because it is the overall morphology of the figure
that is meaningful. In Figure P-1, despite large variations in the ballistic coefficient (as a proxy
for atmospheric density), the Pc changes little. This event is not sensitive to space weather
mismodeling, and thus actionability is not strongly affected by solar storm developments and
potential mismodeling.

Figure P-1 SWTS Plot for Invariant Situation29
In Figure P-2, the current Pc, as represented by the center point of the figure, lies on a ‚Äúridge‚Äù of
high Pc values; any atmospheric drag mismodeling that moves the situation off the center point

will result in a lower rather than higher Pc. So, if the current Pc is below the threshold that would
require a mitigation action, the event should still be safe even in the presence of model error.

Finally, in situations in which the Pc is not on a ridge and where non-trivial variation is
observed, then model error could either increase or decrease the Pc, as shown in Figure P-3. In
such cases, one is left without the reassurance of either of the two previous examples. However,
given that the estimation process attempts to take account of drag uncertainty through modeling
even of solar storms, the CDM result is presumed to represent the best estimate possible and, in
the absence of other indicting data, is expected to be reliable and actionable.

P.10 Summary
As the previous discussion indicates, the orbit determination and propagation process nearly
always produces data that can be considered actionable. There are certain indications that an
orbit-determination fit may potentially fall short, and an even smaller number that would counsel
the dismissal of an orbit determination as the basis for conjunction risk assessment. It is similarly
infrequent that the propagation results to TCA can be questioned, and these situations can
usually be addressed in other ways (e.g., the repair of a non-positive-definite covariance). In both
situations, there are additional one-sided tests that, if passed, can reassure the user about the
propriety of the data and its ability to subtend conjunction risk assessment.

Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event
Processing
Q.1 Introduction
While appendices E through P in this Handbook address many of the technical aspects of the
conjunction event processing discipline, this appendix illustrates how the individual pieces come
together to perform on-orbit conjunction risk assessment. The operational orbital safety process
is illustrated through a series of graphical displays that conjunction risk assessors use to
determine whether a mitigation action is warranted for a particular conjunction and, if it is, what
sorts of such actions might be effective in adequately reducing the collision risk.
The graphical displays in this appendix are a subset of those used by the NASA CARA group to
perform risk assessment in protection of NASA‚Äôs fleet of non-human space flight satellites, and
the examples presented are for a recent actual event that resulted in the planning and execution of
a mitigation action. To facilitate public release of the information, neither spacecraft is
specifically identified, and the orbital data have been slightly altered.
NASA executes conjunction assessment screenings of its assets against the DOD space catalog
once every eight hours, and for the orbit regime that contains the particular protected asset in use
in this example, a screening volume of 0.5 km x 17 km x 20 km was used. This particular
conjunction appeared at the 6.5 days-to-TCA point, which means that it was essentially
identified as early as possible (using 7-day predicted ephemerides for the primary object).
Because the initial Pc was greater than 1E-07, this event was in ‚Äúyellow‚Äù status from the very
beginning, meaning that the collision likelihood was high enough to merit close attention as the
event developed. As such, the conjunction risk assessment process was engaged from the
beginning.
The displays in this appendix follow this event from initial detection to the mitigation action
commitment point, which for this event was one day prior to the time of the closest approach.
Commentary is provided for each display, and since there is always more that can be said about
each display, the commentary is reasonably abbreviated and focused on the most salient points of
each presentation.

Q.2 Primary and Secondary Object Background Information
In making a risk assessment determination, it is important to have information about the orbits
and maintenance history of the primary and secondary objects as background. Different orbits
have different properties and expected stability, and maintenance histories and parameters testify
to the quality of the orbit determination available to analyze this event. It is helpful to display
these data in consolidated form so that the parameters of interest can be viewed and apprehended
quickly.

In most cases, the primary object is much better maintained than the secondary object, meaning
that the primary object‚Äôs orbit determination information is generally good and therefore not
determinative in assessing the event‚Äôs overall data quality. Furthermore, if the object is screened
using the owner/operator (O/O) ephemeris, there will typically not be any available orbit
determination estimation information at all. But it is helpful to examine whatever information is
available for the primary object to make sure the situation is well understood.
One observes that the primary is in a nearly circular, sun-synchronous LEO orbit with an average
altitude of about 700km. The energy dissipation rate (EDR) value indicates that, while drag has
an effect, it is relatively mild. The altitude is such that both drag and solar radiation pressure
(SRP) should be modeled, and the two resultant solved-for values are reasonable. (Consult
Appendix P for acceptable ranges of values for parameters such as this.) The weighted root mean
square (WRMS) value here is low enough not to raise any objection. The tracking density is
reasonably large, and tracking data has been included in the orbital solution that was collected
within the last day, so propagation to TCA will not have to extend very far into the future.
Overall, this primary satellite is well maintained and not propagated excessively, so there is
nothing to indicate any problems with the fit or propagation.
Q.2.2 Secondary Object Information
Basic orbital and orbit determination estimation information for the secondary object is shown in
Table Q-2.

Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

191

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Table Q-2 Secondary Satellite Vital Statistics

The orbit of the secondary object is not substantially different from that of the primary, although
the inclination is somewhat lower. However, due presumably to a different area-to-mass ratio,
the drag influence is much higher for the secondary object: the high EDR value indicates a
significant drag effect, and this is confirmed by the large solved-for ballistic coefficient. The
orbit altitude indicates that SRP should be solved for as well, and it is: the large value here also
indicates a high area-to-mass ratio. The tracking levels for the secondary object are poor: 0.5
tracks/day is an order of magnitude smaller than the tracking density for the primary.
Examining the Conjunction Data Message (CDM) (not shown here) reveals that the 15
observations (obs) used in the latest orbit determination update for this object span a 9.5-day
period. Thus, while the overall tracking situation is not the best, the length of the update interval
(LUPI) is only half the maximum value and therefore tolerable. (Consult Appendix P for
information about the LUPI parameter.) The fact that all the tracking comes from a single sensor
is undesirable, but it is a circumstance that is observed occasionally with small debris objects,
which this is given its radar cross section (RCS) value. The WRMS is high but below the quality
threshold of 5 for a debris object. Data in the CDM also indicates that the propagation time to
TCA is not all that long (a few days) and certainly much shorter than the length of the update
interval.
Overall, while the maintenance history and propagation situation for this object is not the best, it
is good enough to serve as a basis for risk assessment, presuming that other issues (e.g., space
weather) do not ultimately jeopardize the credibility of the propagation.

Q.3 Primary and Secondary Object Trajectories
The ground trace plot shown in Figure Q-1 depicts the two satellite trajectories in relation to each
other and identifies the geographical position of their point of closest approach.

Secondary
Protected Object
Object

Figure Q-1 Ground Trace Plot
In the above encounter, the closest-approach point‚Äîover Antarctica‚Äîis far away from the field
of regard of any of the SSN ground sensors, meaning that this part of both satellites‚Äô trajectories
will not be modeled as well as if the ground sensor were directly under the point of closest
approach. The relative velocity value indicated in Figure Q-1, almost 14 km/sec, is both very fast
and typical for LEO conjunctions; it is certainly large enough to allow hyperkinetic assumptions
about the conjunction to inhere and thus to allow the use of simplified approaches to calculating
the probability of collision, such as the 2D Pc.
The approach angle may also be of some interest. A zero-degree approach angle describes a
situation in which one object ‚Äúchases‚Äù another, usually presenting lower-velocity encounters; a
180-degree approach angle constitutes a ‚Äúhead-on‚Äù collision. In both such instances, in-track
error plays a smaller role in the conjunction dynamics because it controls the timing of any
collision more than whether a collision would in fact take place. (This is of course only partially
true because in-track error is usually correlated with radial error and thus will engender a radial
component.) Values in between these extremes describe the typically encountered oblique
situation, which is the case in this particular event being evaluated.

Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

Q.4 Conjunction Plane Information
The Figure Q-2 visual, called a Conjunction Plane Plot, communicates certain information about
the event. In interpreting this representation, it may be helpful to review the development of the
2D Pc calculation methodology outlined in Appendix N.

Figure Q-2 Conjunction Plane Plot
The relative miss vector lies along the x-axis, with one end at the origin and the other terminating
at the blue dot. This blue ‚Äúdot‚Äù is in fact a circle with a radius equaling the hard-body radius
(HBR) that represents the combined sizes of the primary and secondary objects. The ellipses
represent the combined uncertainty of the primary and secondary objects‚Äô positions, here
resolved from an ellipsoid to an ellipse in the plane in which a collision, should it occur, would
take place.
For low-likelihood conjunctions, the blue dot is far outside of the three-sigma ellipse, and
frequently, the ellipse itself is collapsed onto the x-axis, indicating that the in-track error is
dominating the conjunction. In the case being discussed, the situation is different: the blue dot is
within the one-sigma error ellipse, and the ellipse itself has visible definition, indicating that the
uncertainties in this situation are more varied.

Q.5 Collision Probability Evolution
The Figure Q-3 graphic gives a time history of the probability of collision (Pc) during this
event‚Äôs development.

Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

194

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook

Figure Q-3 Probability of Collision Time-History Plot
While it is true that in most cases operational practice is grounded correctly on the Pc at the
‚Äúmitigation action commitment point‚Äù (namely, that temporal point before TCA at which a
decision must be rendered regarding whether a mitigation action will take place), the behavior of
the Pc over the event‚Äôs history does help to indicate whether the event‚Äôs risk assessment data are
stable enough to allow a durable risk assessment decision to be made.
Figure Q-3 shows the Pc time history:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

For the primary and secondary objects‚Äô states and covariances based on the skin-tracking
results (indicated as ‚ÄúASW‚Äù in the legend), and
For the primary object‚Äôs state and covariance derived from a submitted owner/operator
ephemeris (indicated as ‚ÄúO/O‚Äù in the legend).

An additional feature of Figure Q-3 is that the graphic markers (square or circle) are filled in for
the particular updates that received new tracking.
Figure Q-3 makes clear that the secondary object is not particularly well tracked; most of the
updates, noted by the open markers, are based only on the update of the space weather
coefficients and do not constitute a new state estimate resulting from fresh tracking. However,
the significant state update that does contain new tracking (just a little less than two days to
TCA) is barely under the mitigation threshold (red line), and after additional space weather
Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

195

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
updates, the last such update before the mitigation action commitment point (one day) exceeds
the red threshold. While there is a large variation observed in the Pc history, it is not so extreme
as to indicate to an analyst that the situation is so unstable that a mitigation action cannot be
planned or counselled wisely. As such, based (provisionally) on Figure Q-3, it would be
recommended for this O/O to take a mitigation action.

Q.6 Miss Distance Evolution
While the Pc is the collision likelihood metric of choice, it is helpful to examine the miss
distance history as well to see if it is manifesting a dramatically different pattern from the Pc
history.

Figure Q-4 Total Miss Distance Plot
Miss distance is one of the principal inputs to the Pc, but the combined covariance and HBR are
also important. There are cases in which the miss distance behaves in a manner that would seem
to reduce collision risk but the covariance evolution is such that the collision likelihood remains
high; in such situations, further investigation is prudent.
When comparing Figure Q-4 to the Pc history, one observes a situation in which the miss
distance evolution is not in obvious lock-step with the Pc evolution, which is not an unusual
outcome given what appears to be happening with the covariance evolution at the same time. But
one also observes a situation for which the miss distance has moved to a very low value in the
Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

196

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
last update. Even though this is not brought about via a tracking update but just space weather
model updates, it is small enough to have driven the Pc above the mitigation threshold. While in
principle it could change at the next update and push the Pc below the threshold, the situation is
not so contradictory that one would assert that it has no predictive force.
As such, the miss distance behavior does not work against a conclusion that collision mitigation
is appropriate.
Q.6.1 Miss Distance Component Behavior
In Figure Q-5, the individual miss distance components are examined, which is a more
meaningful display of the time history of this particular datum.

Figure Q-5 Componentized Miss Distance Plot
Figure Q-5 also gives a time-history of miss distance behavior, but it separates the miss distance,
helpfully, into three components centered on the primary object:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

The radial miss (in the direction toward the center of the Earth),
The in-track miss (perpendicular to the radial miss in the plane of the orbit), and
The cross-track miss (the direction perpendicular to this plane).

Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

197

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
The blue circles represent the signed miss distance in the particular component of interest (and if
filled in, tracking was received as part of the state estimate update that produced that miss
distance), and the red squares represent the one-sigma uncertainty for that miss component.
Ideal behavior is a set of blue circles that essentially stay at the same value update to update,
while the red squares shrink closer to that value as the propagation length is decreased from
7 days to ~1 day.
The in-track results above (middle graph) essentially exhibit this behavior: the in-track miss does
not fluctuate wildly (although the y-axis scale should be kept in mind), and the uncertainties
shrink nicely as the event develops.
The situation is somewhat less well-behaved for the cross-track graph (far right), but in the main,
the actual miss does converge to a value while the uncertainties shrink.
The radial component, however, does not behave so nicely; and since this miss component is the
most determinative for the Pc, it needs to be watched carefully.
‚Ä¢

First, one should notice how much smaller the radial miss values are compared to the
other two components. It is because of this small radial miss that this event is a high-risk
event in the first place.

‚Ä¢

Second, its evolution would have to be characterized as at least somewhat unstable: it
changes sign and does not uniformly focus on a single value over time. However, such
behavior is not truly unusual for the radial component.

‚Ä¢

Third, when fresh tracking is finally obtained, the miss distance does jump and changes
sign, but it jumps to a worrisome value (nearly zero) and does not stray far from that
value as the event pushes forward to the mitigation action commitment point.

The fact that this key component of the high-risk designation stays reasonably stable coming into
the mitigation action commitment point gives additional confidence that the reasonably high Pc
value should be taken seriously.
Q.6.2 Normalized Component Miss Distance Value Comparison
Figure Q-6 is a different way to render the development of the componentized miss distance as
the event builds to TCA. Rather than actual component miss distance values, Figure Q-6
represents normalized values: the change in componentized miss distance divided by the
expected error in that component from the previous update. In essence, Figure Q-6 reflects how
well or poorly each update behaves with regard to its expected error.
Ideal performance would be for updates to sit very close to the zero line: there would be strong
agreement update to update, and any actual difference between predictions would be small
compared to the prediction error or, to be more precise, ~68% of such ratios would fall within
the +1 to -1 regions.

Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

198

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook

Figure Q-6 State Comparison Consistency Plot
The behavior shown in Figure Q-6 is quite desirable. Most values are very near the zero-line, and
the few that are not do not deviate much beyond the one-sigma region. One can encounter
situations in which gyrations beyond the three-sigma region occur throughout; in comparison to
that, the above is very well behaved. It is also not unusual to see notable changes introduced as
the result of additional tracking; the value for the radial component right after the two-days-toTCA vertical line (red filled dot) is an example of this.
Overall, this is a reasonably well-behaved event whose final result can be trusted to yield an
actionable result.

Q.7 Space Weather Considerations
The space weather situation is important to consider when ascertaining whether the orbital
dynamics are expected to be sufficiently stable that the data examined at the mitigation action
commitment point are expected to inhere until TCA.
Q.7.1 Solar Storms
The main area of interest in Figure Q-7 is the expectation of effects from solar storms such as
coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and these are best predicted by examining the disturbance storm
time (Dst) parameter prediction.
Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

Figure Q-7 Solar Storm Prediction
The upper part of Figure Q-7 gives both a history and prediction of this parameter: the historical
data are in black, the one-hour Anemomilos (the model used by the DOD to predict this
parameter) given in blue, and the longer-term Anemomilos forecasts given in purple; the current
time is indicated by the vertical dotted line.
Dips in Dst are the behavior of significance with a threshold of -75 nanoTeslas being the
threshold used by CARA to indicate a disturbed situation. In Figure Q-7, one can observe a dip
below this value, then a ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù increase, then some residual dipping before steadying off and
heading to the zero value. The prediction shows a linear increase to the zero value, which
indicates a stable situation.
The takeaway from Figure Q-7 is that, while the space weather situation was somewhat
perturbed in the event‚Äôs recent history, at the current time (indicated by the vertical dotted line),
it appears to have largely stabilized, and the future situation looks to be only more stable.
Therefore, one can be reasonably comfortable acting on the present data at the maneuver
commitment point since space weather is not likely to cause unexpected changes in drag
predictions through the time of closest approach.

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
Q.7.2 Space Weather Modeling
Figure Q-8 communicates the expected effect on the probability of collision if the space weather
situation has been mismodeled in the predicted object trajectories.

Figure Q-8 Space Weather Trade-Space Plot
Note that Figure Q-7 and the outcome of this particular event outline a situation in which Figure
Q-8 probably would not be used operationally, but in a discussion of this type, it seems
appropriate to include the information nonetheless.
To determine whether space weather has been mismodeled, one first recognizes that, in the drag
equation, the atmospheric density estimate and the ballistic coefficient are multiplicatively
coupled; this means that the effect of changing one of these parameters can be emulated by
changing the other. To produce Figure Q-8, the ballistic coefficients for the primary and
secondary objects were increased and decreased incrementally by up to half an order of
magnitude in each direction (e.g., the ‚ÄúPrimary Drag Scale Factor‚Äù on the x-axis spans from -0.5
to 0.5 in log space). This produces the same effect on predicted position if the atmospheric
density were mismodeled by that amount. The colors on the intensity plot are the base-ten
logarithm of the Pc.
What is important in the presentation, however, is not the actual Pc values but the morphology of
the plot. If the midpoint (which represents the current actual solution) is on a ‚Äúridge,‚Äù as in
Figure Q-8, any mismodeling of the atmospheric density will result in a lower Pc value. Thus, if
the current Pc is below one‚Äôs threshold for action, one can embrace a decision to dismiss the
Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

201

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
conjunction; i.e., if the current Pc value is below the threshold, and any mismodeling is expected
only to lower the Pc from that value, then the event can be considered safe.
A presentation that is essentially one-color results in a similar conclusion because in such a case,
the presentation is indicating that the event is simply not sensitive to atmospheric density
mismodeling. If, however, the midpoint dot is on a ‚Äúslope‚Äù (e.g., if it were on one of the light
blue lines in Figure Q-8), then mismodeling could potentially either increase or decrease the Pc.
Thus, in such a case, the event is sensitive to atmospheric density mismodeling, and changes may
be observed in future orbit determination updates in either direction that could affect the decision
to maneuver. If the event is close to the red threshold, CARA would typically recommend
maneuvering despite the space weather uncertainty for conservatism.

Q.8 Mitigation Maneuver Planning
To assist O/Os in planning mitigation actions, a ‚ÄúManeuver Trade-Space‚Äù plot similar to Figure
Q-9 is produced.

Figure Q-9 Maneuver Trade-Space Plot
A potential mitigation burn, taken from a variety of different burn sizes at a variety of different
execution times, is placed into the primary object‚Äôs ephemeris, the altered ephemeris is
propagated forward, new Pcs for both the main conjunction under consideration and any other
conjunctions that arise from this altered trajectory are calculated, and the Pc that is an
amalgamation of these individual Pc values is calculated. This calculation is run over and over,
working through the entire range of burn intensities and burn times, and from the results, an
Appendix Q. Notional Display Flow for Conjunction Event Processing

202

NASA Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance
Best Practices Handbook
intensity plot like Figure Q-9 is constructed. The colors indicated on the second y-axis at right
indicate the Pc (1E-X, where X is the value on the axis) that will be achieved if a burn of the
magnitude chosen on the x axis and the phasing time chosen on the right axis is executed.
Choosing a maneuver time and magnitude that result in a Pc of 1E-07 (dark blue) would be
considered to fully mitigate the conjunction risk.
A number of interesting conclusions can be drawn from a Maneuver Trade-Space plot. If it is the
case that the O/O wishes to mitigate the risk down to the CARA-recommended level of 3E-06,
then a maneuver should be chosen that lies along the dashed white line above. The longer one
waits to perform the maneuver, the larger the maneuver will need to be; the maneuver possibility
shown in the bottom right of the graph is twice as large as the one shown at the top right, so
maneuvering early allows a smaller maneuver to fully mitigate the conjunction. However, it is
also often the case that waiting an additional half-day will allow more tracking data to be
collected that will shrink the covariance and potentially push the Pc below the red threshold,
meaning no maneuver would be necessary at all. This tension ultimately must be resolved by the
O/O: does the O/O want to commit early and lock in a smaller maneuver, or does the O/O want
to wait to act until the maneuver commitment point, hoping that the need for the maneuver will
evaporate completely? The risk of waiting is that a large maneuver would be required to mitigate
the conjunction, or that it may not be possible to fully mitigate the risk given the size maneuver
that the spacecraft has the capability to perform.
Note that Figure Q-9 does not dictate any specific action to the O/O; instead, it provides general
guidance for the sizes and timing of maneuvers that that meet chosen mitigation requirements.
Based on these data, the O/O selects a promising maneuver (or set of maneuvers), builds them
into predicted ephemerides, and submits them to the conjunction assessment screening authority
for screening. This latter action is necessary because it is the only way to give assurance of both
the safety of the proposed is necessary because it is the only way to give assurance of both the
safety of the proposed maneuver (or set of maneuvers) relative to other on-orbit objects and the
actual amount of risk reduction that the maneuver (or set of maneuvers) can be expected to yield.
In this example, the collision likelihood is above the CARA mitigation threshold (1E-04) at the
maneuver commitment point used by the O/O for this spacecraft, and mitigation actions that
appropriately reduce the risk are available and not large enough to negatively affect the satellite‚Äôs
main mission appreciably. Therefore, the O/O made the straightforward decision to perform a
mitigation action.
